I have collected information regarding latest progress made in solving
of system of Linear Equations. Interestingly this works uses spanning
tree (approximate) in solving Linear Equations. Its was amazing that
tree has to do anything with system of linear equations
![smile](http://moodle.iitb.ac.in/pix/s/smiley.gif) . See the attached
beamer. Apparently they claim that they have found the fastest
algorithm. In nutshell, they combined support theory with conjugate
gradient methods. A lot of mathematicians work has been an integral part
of this progress. Dan Spielman to ex EE-IITB Praveen Vaidya [who chose
not to publish his work](http://www.sandia.gov/%7Ebahendr/support.html)
but to produce commercial software instead. There are some good insight
also about interior point methods and Laplacian. May be in the next
version of this document, I'll try to review it. [scribd id=44314781
