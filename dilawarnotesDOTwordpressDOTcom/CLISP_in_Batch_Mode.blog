CLISP in Batch Mode
</TITLE>

<CONTENT>
I struggled few hours to get CLisP working in batch mode (Of course, Internet was down in my room). Here is what I followed to get it working in script mode. Look at this <a href="http://cybertiggyr.com/lscript/">article</a>. Also there is cross-platform LISP interface <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/lambda-gtk/">$latex \lambda$-gtk</a> . The simplest way to do it was to write the function etc in a text file and use 'load' command in CLISPÂ interpreter.

(load &quot;filename&quot;)
