Followings are two prominent simulators available as open-source. 

-   Icarus

-   Verilator -

Icarus is still being developed but it can be used for advanced
assignments. I am not sure whether it support full 'synthesis-able
subset' of Verilog. Verilator is more advanced (to my knowledge), it can
easily be integrated with C++/SystemC/Matlab.
