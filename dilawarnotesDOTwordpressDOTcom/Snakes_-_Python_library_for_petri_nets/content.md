It looks promising and cool. Snakes is a Python library for working with
Petri-nets. I am playing around with it so can't say much about it right
now. Here is [some
blogs](http://pommereau.blogspot.in/2010/01/quickly-prototyping-petri-nets-tools.html)
about it by its author. It is hosted on
[google-code](http://code.google.com/p/python-snakes/). A long list of
petri-nets related tools is available
[here](http://www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/TGI/PetriNets/tools/). Some
of them are no longer active or dead or both.
