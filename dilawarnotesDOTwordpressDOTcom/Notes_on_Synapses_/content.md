-   During the development of neural circuits, excessive synapses are
    formed in a genetically programmed manner.  Neural circuits are
    refined by the experience dependent pruning of supernumerary
    imprecise connections and the strengthening of the functional
    synapses. The molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain
    largely unknown. In [1], authors describe the role of ephrin-A2 in
    regulating experience dependent, NMDA-receptor mediated synaptic
    pruning through glial glutamate transport during maturation of the
    mouse cortex.
