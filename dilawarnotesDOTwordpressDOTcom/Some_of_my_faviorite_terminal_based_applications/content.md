Some of my favorite applications. Hope, they will serve you as well as
they have been serving me. [Here is another terminal
lover](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/hacks.html)with some hacks.

-   Desktop manager : Xmonad (Haskell), Awesome (lua).  Both are tiling
    window manager. Useful for programmers. If you don't want to install
    Haskell, I'd suggest to use awesome. Using them and configuring them
    is not easy. You have to know either Haskell or Lua. Learning Lua is
    easy, Haskell is functional programming language.
-   File browser : [ranger](http://ranger.nongnu.org/).
-   Email client : mutt (what else?). Alpine is also good.
-   DC client : microdc2. Eiskaltdcpp has deamon, limited support for
    scripting so far). Microdc2 is very lightweight. Good to have if a
    lot of files gets downloaded from your system. Eiskaltdcpp has
    spy-mode, you can also see what sort of keywords are being search on
    network (No prize for guessing most common words! Though the
    frequencies are bit surprising.)
-    Markup to various formats : pandoc. This is really cool.
-    Terminal based IDEs : vim (or Emacs), with respective plugins.
-    rss2email (google-reader is going away).
-   Music player (mpd + mpc) (Mpd is really light), cmus.
-   Screen (Those who ssh to other machines often : Attaching and
    detaching session)
-   News reader (slrn). [pnews.iitb.ac.in](http://pnews.iitb.ac.in)
-   Downloading emails (backup) : getmail4
-   Vimpress (to edit wordpress blogs inside vim) : [transparent
    proxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server "Proxy server")
    required if any. You can also have a look at python [based library
    wordpress.py](https://github.com/dilawar/pywordpress) on my github.
-   Web-browser : elinks (works well with mutt to read html emails),
    lyx.

PS : Vim-lover must try vimpretor addon with Firefox.
