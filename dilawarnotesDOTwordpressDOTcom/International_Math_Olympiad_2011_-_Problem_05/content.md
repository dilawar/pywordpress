**Problem statement :**Let \$latex f\$ be a function from the set of
integers to the set of positive integers. Suppose that, for any two
integers m and n, the difference \$latex f(m) - f(n)\$ is divisible by
\$latex f(m-n)\$. Prove that, for all integers m and n with \$latex f(m)
\\leq f(n)\$, the number \$latex f(n)\$ is divisible by \$latex f(m)\$.
**Solution :** \$latex \\frac{f(m)- f(n)}{f(m-n)} \\in \\mathbb{Z\^+}\$
