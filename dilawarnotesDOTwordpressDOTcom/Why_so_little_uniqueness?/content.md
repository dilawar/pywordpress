Now, India, along with Madagaskar, broke away from Africa some 160
million years ago. She spent more than 100 million years in isolation
before colliding with Asia and thus giving birth to Himalyas. For more
than 100 millions years in isolation and still so little unique species
are found on India.

A paper with an scary title of "[**Biogeographic and evolutionary
implications of a diverse paleobiota in amber from the early Eocene of
India**](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/43/18360.full)" sheds some
lights on this fact. The Hindu has written
[editorial](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/article888146.ece)
about it even if no one seems to care about it. Recent excavations of
rich outcrops of 50–52-million-year-old amber with diverse inclusions
from the Cambay Shale of Gujarat, western India address this issue. Now
Cambay amber occurs in lignitic and muddy sediments concentrated around
shores. 'The amber is very partially polymerized and readily dissolves
in organic solvents, thus allowing extraction of whole insects whose
cuticle retains microscopic fidelity' says paper.

> Fourteen orders and more than 55 families and 100 species of arthropod

Now, than there is  one explanation which Hindu supports,

> If a land bridge link between the drifting Indian landmass and Africa

When it comes to natural wealth, India is not so unique after all.
