Use[this
script](https://raw.github.com/dilawar/Scripts/master/record_my_desktop.sh).
Make sure \~/Video directory exits on your computer. And ffmpeg is also
installed. This script computes the resolution of your desktop and saves
the video to \~/Video/output.mkv file. The file size is typically very
big (high definition) which you can again reduce to by converting the
file to some other format using ffmpeg. No need to use GUI application.
