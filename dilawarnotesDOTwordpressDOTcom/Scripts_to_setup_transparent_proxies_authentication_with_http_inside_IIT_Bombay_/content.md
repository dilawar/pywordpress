[Clone these repo](https://github.com/dilawar/Transparent-Proxy) or
download it as a zip file and follow the instructions given in README.md
file. It should set-up transparent proxies on your Linux machine. It
uses [redsocks](http://darkk.net.ru/redsocks/) which is added to
repository. Donâ€™t ask me anything on how to do it on Windows. I am
Windows illiterate and have no intentions learning it unless someone
pays me. You can read about usefulness of transparent proxies
[here.](http://pritambaral.com/2012/04/transparent-proxy-on-linux/) You
can now use [Vimpress](https://github.com/vim-scripts/VimRepress) to
edit and post your blogs from vim editor. Credits and acknowledgments
are in Readme file. DO NOT SETUP on servers unless you wants them to use
your transparent proxies.
