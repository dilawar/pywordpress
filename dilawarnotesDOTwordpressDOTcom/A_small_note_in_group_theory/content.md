We are going to do a problem which took me two-hours to solve. I am
happy that I did it without looking at book or browsing Internet.
**Statement :**Let \$latex G\$ be the set of all \$latex 2 \\times 2\$
matrices  \$latex \\left[ \\begin{array} {cc} a & b \\\\ c & d 
\\end{array} \\right ] \$ where \$latex a, b, c, d\$ are integers modulo
\$latex p\$, \$latex p\$ is a prime number. It can be verified that
\$latex G\$ is a non-abelian finite group. How many element does \$latex
G\$ have? **Solution :**
