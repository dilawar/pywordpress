**UPDATE : Source code is moved to a git repository,
http://github.com/dilawar/sound** **This work is derivative of Dr.
Taylor's
work**[http://people.msoe.edu/\~taylor/examples/wav.htm](http://people.msoe.edu/~taylor/examples/wav.htm)
. **There was a bug in his implementation which is removed from this
implementation.** **** We give here c++ class to read WAV file and store
its content in an array. We also store these values in a ASCII file and
plot it using `gnuplot` to check whether we get it right.
[`praat`](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) can be used to confirm
whether our output is right or not. Google to read about the WAV format.
**We only support non-compressed WAV file.**

**WAV File Format**
===================

We do not support compressed WAV file. Format which is programmed here
is available here
[https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/422/projects/WaveFormat/](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/422/projects/WaveFormat/).

Implementation
==============

The Makefile project can be found at github repository
http://github.com/dilawar/sound .  After compilation (using `make all)`,
you'll get the binary `parseSpeech`. Use this binary
`./parseSpeech -f `. If your wav file is long (more than 3-4 seconds)
the txt file generated by this program `speechData.txt` will be very
lengthy. Use can use `gnuplot` to draw the waveform. **We are sorry for
not giving an extensive documentation on this. ******
