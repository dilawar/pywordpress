Simulation will not work in future! That much I am sure of. You just can
not simulate all the possible combination described specification in a
modern day VLSI design. Even if you have 1000 of computers at your
disposal. It would be foolhardy to do so. However, simulation with
formal methods may yields wonderful results. We concentrate on the
formal methods here. Any improvement in these methods will be of great
values for VLSI verification. [scribd id=44315276
