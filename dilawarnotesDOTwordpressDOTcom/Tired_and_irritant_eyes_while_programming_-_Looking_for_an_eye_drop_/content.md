I have found moisol eyedrops very nice. I use them regularly. Great for
tired and irritant eyes. It has a very soothing effect on eyes. You can
get it for free (after prescription) from IIT Bombay hospital (if you
are a student or staff) or buy it from a medical store. It costs around
Rs. 18 for 5ml.
