Matroids can be defined in many ways. It is, however, non-trivial to
prove that these alternative definitions are 'equivalent'. Here we used
'closed-set' definition of Matroid. **Matroid** A matroid \$latex M=(E,
F)\$ is a finite set \$latex E\$ together with \$latex F\$, family of
subsets of \$latex M\$ satisfying the following three axioms. (1)
\$latex E \\in F\$. (2) If \$latex A, B \\in F\$ then \$A \\cap B \\in
F\$
