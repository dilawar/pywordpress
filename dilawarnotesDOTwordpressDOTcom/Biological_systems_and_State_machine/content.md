State machines are very tempting representation of systems. People say
that they are the simplest representation of system and more abstracts
are stack based state machine and the most abstract is the 'Turing
Machines'. There are also some debate which kind of language is best
suited to program them. As far as bilogical system are concerned which
are of course most natural, the support in favor of 'funtional
languages' or 'languages which can completely model reactive systems.'.
This chap seems to be an expert on these matters. People who are
intersted in these aspects may llike to read him.
