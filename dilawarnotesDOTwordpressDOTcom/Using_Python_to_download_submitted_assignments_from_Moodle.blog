Using Python to download submitted assignments from Moodle
</TITLE>

<CONTENT>
UPDATE : This will not work on new moodle used in IIT Bombay. New moodle allows downloading all assignments as a single file. You can use<a href="https://github.com/dilawar/Scripts/blob/master/moodle_assignment_part.py"> this script</a> to extract individual assignments.

Downloading each student's assignment from moodle could be a real pain especially when you have to grade them. Last night, I worked my ass off and created this <a href="https://github.com/dilawar/MyPublic/tree/master/MoodleIITB">Python scripts</a> which can fetch assignments from Moodle course page. In your home folder <tt>.moodlerc</tt> file must exists with all details (see the sample file on <a href="https://github.com/dilawar/MyPublic/tree/master/MoodleIITB">git repository</a>). It depends heavily of <tt>mechanize</tt> python-library.

Each line (not suffixed with char #) is configuration variable in <tt>key = value </tt> format. Username and password fields are usual moodle username and password. If you leave password field empty then you have to submit it during exectution. Next is <tt>course</tt> which should be a regular pattern i.e. if course is <tt> EE 705 : V L S I Design Lab </tt> then <tt>course = EE 705 </tt> would be fine. Notice that you do not have to enclose any text string using commas etc. If you have two courses with same regular pattern then only first of them will be selected. Then we have <tt>activities</tt> which shout be set to <tt>Assignments</tt> (open your moodle course page and see what is exact spelling in your course page for assignment, casing of characters matters.) Once you will click on assignments, there would be more than one assignments, all of them can be put using <tt>activity = </tt> line. For instance, in sample file <tt>Lab session 1</tt> and <tt>Lab session 2</tt> are two assignments. It will take care of the rest. It will go to each student, create a directory in his/her name and download submission into that directory. If <tt>extract=true</tt> then it will also extract archive files. Make sure only one archive file is submitted per assignment.

This is the first version of this script and I may work on it after some time. If you make any change please share it with online community.

PS : Some moodle server does not allow robots and automatic logging. To overcome this, this scripts sends wrong information to moodle-server. It mimics "mozilla firefox on ubuntu". If you dont have any ethical issues with such non-sense then you are more than welcome to use this script. Â Released under GNU-GPL Lesser Public License.
