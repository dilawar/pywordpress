Looking for student/human/aliens from IITB (others are also welcome if
communication can be established) to collaborate on this. Idea is to
extract 'akshars' from spoken Hindi (or any language which can be
encoded in devnagiri). Some progress has already been made by TIFR
([http://speech.tifr.res.in/](http://speech.tifr.res.in/)) . But we are
not going to use traditional approaches which are optimized for Englsih.
Any crazy person with a computer is welcome. Would be more than happy to
talk about it.
NOTE : Its not official, so no financial support from IITB. Personal
curiosity.
Have a look at this
document [here](https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B4ESF3HyeesnMThlNDhkMTEtYThkZi00NGM1LThkYTUtZGU5OTBhNTc3Y2Iy&sort=name&layout=list&num=50).
This contains minimal information.
I will be more than happy to talk about my ongoing work on Interior
point method and electrical networks if you find that interesting. I am
using only primitive graph theory so should not be a problem for an
undergraduate also. You can see a (not a very clear) presentation on
it [here](http://dilawarnotes.wordpress.com/2010/11/28/notes-graphand-linear-systems-in-laplacian-matrix/)
