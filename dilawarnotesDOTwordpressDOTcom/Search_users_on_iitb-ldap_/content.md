This [python
scripts](https://github.com/dilawar/Scripts/blob/master/mutt/mutt-ldap.py)searches
iitb ldap for users. It is a modified version of some other scripts.
Script header is not modified and original author still holds the
copyright. You need to install python-ldap. I use it with my mutt to
search emails of students.
