Finally, I stumbled upon something on how to manage labels in mutt. See
[this post](http://blitiri.com.ar/p/other/mutt-labels/). I have been
using mutt for two years but I never really needed this feature. As the
usage of email is increasing, this is a great way to label the emails.
It is much better than tagging. Good thing about it that it adds label
to 'X-label' field of the mail itself and display it in the pager. So
labels are stored inside the mail only. Neat!
