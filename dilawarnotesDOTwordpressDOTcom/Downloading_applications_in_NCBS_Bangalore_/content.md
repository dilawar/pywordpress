Currently I am spending a year in NCBS Bangalore. I like to experiment
with Operating Systems (OS). Needless to say, I download them often. And
they can be pretty big (\>500 Mb usually). In NCBS, speed is often poor
but there is a catch. Speed over FTP is much better (upto 1 mb per sec)
than it is over http (upto 100K per sec). Not all FTP servers are fast
enough, some are pretty bad. I found riken serverÂ  to be pretty fast
(http://ftp.riken.jp/) and I recommend it. DO NOT download from ftp
using browser. Use lftp/wget/curl or some other ftp clients to feel the
speed.
