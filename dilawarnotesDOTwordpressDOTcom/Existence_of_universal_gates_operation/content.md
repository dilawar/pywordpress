Take Boolean Algebra with two elements \$latex (0, 1)\$ for instance,
the underlying finite field \$latex 0,1,\\{.,+\\}\$ is equivalent to
\$latex 0,1,\\{NAND\\}\$ or \$latex 0,1,\\{NOR\\}\$ where NAND and NOR
are considered as universal gates. This means that instead of defining
two operations \$latex (+, .) \$, I can work with either NAND or NOR and
all things will fall in places. Is this property, which is true in 2
elements field, that \$latex .\$('multiplication') and \$latex +\$
('addition') can be written in terms of a single universal binary
relation (e.g. NAND or NOR) is true with every finite fields(rings)? I
have posted it on a online math community. The link is here,
