        ==========
        A command line tool to manage your blogs on ``wordpress.com``.
        
        Configuration file 
        ------------------
        
        Create configuration file ``~/.config/twordpressrc`` with following entry::
        
            # This file must be saved as ~/.wordpressrc 
            [blog0]
            # Url of blog. 
            url=dilawarnotes.wordpress.com
            # Wordpress username
            username=dilawars
            password=mypassword
            [blog1]
            url=blog2.wordpress.com
            username=gabbar
            password=thakur_ke_per_katne_the
        
        If you choose to store this file to some other location then you should pass
        ``--config path/to/twordpressrc`` like option to the ``twordpress`` command.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------ 
        
        A fork of the library
        https://github.com/maxcutler/python-wordpress-xmlrpc/blob/master/docs/index.rst
        is included in this version. 
        
        You can install ``pandoc``. This application turn ``html`` to ``markdown``
        format and vice-versa. I can do more but this is what we need. If ``pandoc`` is
        not available then it uses a python script to turn html to text.
        
        Proxy support is added recently to ``python-wordpress-xmlrcp``. It reads
        environment variable ``http_proxy``. If you are behind proxied network, then
        ``export http_proxy=proxy.something.net:1212`` in your bash. And we are good to
        go.
          
        
        3. Fetch posts 
        --------------
        Following commands fetches post::
        
            twordpress --blog 1 --fetch all
            twordpress --blog 0 --fetch "Python is awesome"
            twordpress 
        
        First command will download all posts and pages from ``blog1``. And second will
        download all posts which matches the given query from ``blog0``. Third command
        will download most recent entries from default blog (``blog0``). Currently it
        does not download media.
          
        Each post gets its own directory and two files ``conetent.md`` and
        ``content.html`` are created. Edit markdown file and run the following command
        to update the post.
        
        4. Updating post 
        ----------------
        
        Following command update the blog. ::
        
            $twordpress --blog 0 --update path_to_new_content.md
        
        5. Create new post 
        ------------------
        This command post a new post::
            
            $twordpress --blog 1 --new new_blog.md
        
        The new blog is written in markdown format but a meta-data has to be prefixed.
        This is how your blog file should look like.::
        
             ---
             title: This is title of my awesome post
             status: publish
             tags: [some awesome tag, tag2]
             categories: [catA, some_category]
             ---
        
             Here is content of blog in markdown format.
        
             Too much has already been written. This ends my blog.
