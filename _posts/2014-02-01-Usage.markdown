First you need to create a configuration file `~/.config/sniffer/config`. You
can see a [sample file here]({{ page.repository_url }}/master/blob/snifferrc).
If you choose to save this file at some other location, you need to specify the
location using `--config` option at command line e.g.

    $ code-sniffer --config ~/.snifferrc 

Let's look at a sample. Options are explained in cofig file itself.

~~~
{% include text/config %}
~~~

You will see something like following when `code-sniffer` is executed
successfully.
