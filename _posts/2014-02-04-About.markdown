This is a python based application. You can write your posts in markdown and
post it on wordpress. `Pandoc` is used to convert markdown to html but if
`pandoc` is not installed on your system then it uses `python-markdown`
package. You should install `python-markdown` at least. We strongly recommend
using `pandoc` for best experience.
