If you are writing your blog posts in markdown, then you need to prefix your
post content with some metadata.

The post must start with following:

~~~~
---
title: Title of the post
title: This is title of my awesome post
status: publish
tags: [some awesome tag, tag2]
categories: [catA, some_category]
---
~~~~

After this you should write in `pandoc` markdown format. Math can be written
between `$$` signs. Wordpress default `$latex tex_formula $` will also work.
