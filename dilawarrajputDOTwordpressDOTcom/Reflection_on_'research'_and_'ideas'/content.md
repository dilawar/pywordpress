Intellect of man is forced to choose\
Perfection of life or of his art\
If its the later then he must refuse\
A heavenly mansion, raging in the dark.
-- Andre Beteille

\
Learning as a shoreless sea; the learner’s days are few;\
Prolonged study is beset with a thousand ills;\
With clear discrimination learn what’s meet f o r you\
Lake swan that leaves the water, drinks the milk.

Few will disagree that 'ideas' play a crucial part in any sort of
'research'. Here I do not want to define 'research' and 'ideas'. Their
most popular definitions will be enough to serve our purpose.\
\
There are many more people who 'consumes' 'ideas' than those who
produces them. This must not be taken in disapproving terms. Its always
better to know pre-established ideas, it helps building new ideas in
better ways. There will be less chances of an idea to be redundant or
insignificant. It is to say that the best way to transcend any idea is
to travel through it and not by jumping over it.\
\
Though we have argued that knowing old ideas is important, but only
knowing them will not serve anybody purpose. We need to have our own
ideas also. Not only to produce multiplicities of views but also and
more importantly to convince ourselves of our worth and intelligence. 
One may romanticize great thinkers and scholars, but at the end of day,
one has to find solace in his own work - no matter of whatever quality.
It is recommended for an individual, and important for an society, that
every one must have few original ideas. For those who wish to make a
mark in academic, its rather much more important. Any self-proclaimed
scholar without original ideas is like a comedian who is not 'funny',
that is, he can not come up with his own jokes but rather steals or
repack other's and tell them in his style. But one must bear in mind
that most of the 'creative scholars' are of the views and one must not
be very obsessed with the 'search of novelty'. Those who are only in
search of novelty do not contribute much to his field.\
\
Once a very prominent sociologist, Max Weber wrote that, '[ideas come to
us when they please and not when it pleases
us](http://books.google.com/books?id=Y_pqZS5q72UC&pg=PA136&dq=idea+comes+to+us+when+they+please+its+not+when+it+pleases+us&hl=en&ei=6_EiTe7wGcjKrAf-gu3HCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false)!'
also they come to us 'when we don't expect them and not when we are
brooding and searching for them.'  I agree with Max Weber, but I would
surely want to make a more generalized remark about them. Ideas come to
us when we are alone, in our own company. Ideas surely will not come to
those who are 24x7 in the company of others, physically or mentally. It
is not a hard conclusion to make since most of prominent thinkers of our
time, loved to spend time with themselves. Like Estha in 'The God of
Small Things',  they were 'polite' yet they did not have (many) friends.
A society which puts a premium on privacy, must be the one who produces
thinkers in large numbers.  In India, at least in my village, privacy is
often seen in negative light. No wonders villages are 'den of
ignorance'.\
\
If ideas do not come to us when it pleases us then surely one has to be
ready for them. Here institutes must play a active part, to keep 'an
individual in readiness should  a new idea choose to come his way'
[Beteille, 2002].\
\
I'd like to make a distinction between ideas and common sense, contrary
to the common sense, that they are different - at least most of the
time. Unlike ideas, 'common sense does not question its own origin and
presuppositions - at least deliberately and methodologically'. Also it
is localized. It is bounded 'by time, place, class, community and
gender' [[Beteille 1996](http://www.jstor.org/stable/4404557)].
Fortunately, the effects of common sense while studying natural sciences
are not as severe as they could be in the case of social sciences.
Natural sciences protect themselves from individual's common sense and
eccentricity by using the language of mathematics.For example, the
'whether a electron is wave of particle' is a valid question as far as
common sense is concerned. But when a single mathematical equation can
describe electron behavior, this question become absurd. An electron is
what its equation implies. Distinguishing between 'wave' and 'particle'
is due to our common sense which has evolved our evolution in a world
where 'wave' and 'particles' are considered different. Common sense make
us incapable of digesting the unintuitive ideas. On the other hand,
mathematics does not really care about intuitions though a great deal of
math is done by intuitions.\
\
Another worthy occupation in research is to criticize the idea. Even
though most of the people do it after taking sides, still its worth it.
If one loves an idea, one generally tends to support it by either
suppressing its weakness or by high-lightening its strength and if one
does not appreciate an idea very much, one tends to do opposite. In
these kind of situations, its becomes rather imperative to rely on
'theory' and 'tools' than on 'intuitions'. Any idea, if fails to
translate itself into en equation, is not going to last very long. And
also, of an idea can not stand criticism, its not worth defending it.\
\
Another criticism 'researchers' generally face is whether the research
they are doing have any social return. Are they doing socially relevant
research? By socially relevant research they generally means 'short term
return'. In fact, this obsession with short term research has taken a
form of epidemic. With rising clouts of industries over academia,
situation has only worsen. It has troubled me by noticing that how
comfortably directors of our research institutes glamorizes 'socially
relevant research'. Its not a job of researcher to provide solutions or
give prescription for social problem. At best, she can do it to help
people understand their problem better. Solutions of a particular
problem generally creates 10 new problems. A problem can never be done
with. At best one can contribute to the understanding of the subject by
removing few hurdles in understanding. And no, I don't think
'development' work done in industries are research. Nonetheless I do not
deny their significance. But this 'development' has no business
belittling the 'research' which our anccesstors were obsessed with.\
\
Few have remarked that nothing very new of fundamental importance is
coming out in the area of scholarships. Well, it depends how you look at
it. In early 19'th century, few things were known for sure. Whatever
someone did was 'new' and 'fundamental'. Now it is almost impossible for
anyone to dump everything whatever has been done and search for
'novelty'. If there is chances of finding novelty, it can only be
attained by going through a particular fields and not by jumping over
it. Universities need to maintain a safe distance from industries if
they dream to produce Raman and Bose.\
\
Not every institute is well versed in every subject. Any Institutes can
only afford to have a narrow bandwidth of research; nonetheless in
teaching they can be quite generic. People are the most important
resources in building up tradition of research in any institute. In
India, although most of our scholars love to take advantage of the works
done by best of the scholars outside India, have shown tremendous
coldness towards work done by our own institutes. If they come back to
India, they simply behave like that they are the first generation of
researchers. In fact, foreigners are more open to cite Indian research
than their NRI counterpart. No nation can flourish unless its habitant
show a interest in building up a tradition of research using their own
native resources.\
