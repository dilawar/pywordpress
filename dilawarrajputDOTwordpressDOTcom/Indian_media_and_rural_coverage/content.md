How little space is given to poverty, labour and agriculture reporting
in Indian media is no secret. This week EPW edition has published a
study high-lightening percentage of new-items in Hindi-English media
about rural area. This study says  that '.. India’s highest circulated
English and Hindi dailies finds that they devote only a minuscule
proportion of their total coverage (about 2%) to rural India’s issues,
crises and anxieties. **Even this low count could be misleading because
most rural news is not about the farmers/villagers or about their
concerns related to land, livestock, resources or farming.**The content
analysis of 968 news items shows that 36% of the coverage goes to issues
of violence, accidents, crime or disasters. Less than 28% is about
agrarian themes while 15% is about hunger, suicides, malnutrition,
distress migration, displacement, or farmers’ movements. The English
newspapers had more coverage of rural distress than the Hindi ones. The
a­uthoritative sources quoted most often in the routine news tend to
belong to the establishment.'\
\
ABOUT EDITORIAL SPACE... On an average, the country’s top circulation
papers devoted about 2% editorial space of their national/flagship
editions with predominantly urban readerships to the issues and concerns
of two-thirds of India.\
\
No newspaper (including Hindu) devotes more than 3.6% of their space to
rural story.\
\
THE QUANTITY OF REPORT... A routine rural story is a brief, single or
double column item on the inside pages and is straight and matter of
fact. Explanations or backgrounders or the likely causes of an incident
are rare. A considerably large number of stories are displayed in the
“briefs” sections which carry just a paragraph or two in a column so
tagged.\
\
SOURCE OF THE REPORT... Most of the prominent and authoritative sources
quoted **are often described by media scholars as the “primary definers”
of the i­ssues involved**. **These sources normally have a stake in the
issues they try to promote or block. Much of the routine news coverage
is a result of a regular interaction between media organisation and
authoritative source organisations.** Normally reporters on the beat
generate news through regular and institutionalised i­nteraction with
government authorities. These sources tend to be mainstream politicians
and bureaucrats, and sometimes the civil society activists and other
alternative sources. (Emphasis mine)\
\
AND THE WORST PART... Tables 8 and 9 show that **bureaucrats are not
among the preferred sources when it comes to stories about extreme rural
poverty or agrarian distress**. However, the government establishment,
particularly **politicians are frequently quoted as sources of news in
this category**. A very high proportion of extreme rural poverty theme
stories originate from the reports of academic and other institutions
such as the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and development
agencies. **It is equally noteworthy that the issues of agrarian
distress are the only area where the peoples’ movements are among the
most quoted sources of news.**\
\
AND THE DRUG-PEDDLERS ARGUMENT [3], "**One reason for their lack of
interest could be explained by the fact that their readers, advertisers
and journalists, particularly in the metropolitan editions, come from
urban backgrounds. The dailies tend to be more consumer focused and try
to fulfil the needs and aspirations of educated and upwardly mobile
urban consumers whose universe often has limited space for issues of
poverty and underdevelopment."**[4]****Now the question arises about the
rural-policies formulated by Santa Banta of planning commission sicne
**'glaring omission of rural news in metro editions assumes significance
because of their disproportionate readership among the policy elites and
opinion leaders.'**[2]\
\
On personal level, I have always found it amusing that the Indian
intelligentsia (whether right, left, centre, any -ist, -vian) has
somewhat mixed attitude towards the rural areas. While educated Indians
are inclined to think or at least speak well for the village, they do
not show much inclination for the company of villagers, or for that
matter, anyone who is less-fortunate than them. This is not unusual or
novel in the city-bred individuals. In fact, some of the very best of
them, Rabindra Nath Tagore, M K Gandhi and Nehru had quite romantic
views about villages. These views were mercilessly castigated by
Ambedkar who unlikely others had the first hand experience of Indian
village life [5]. In a set of lectures delivered at Aligarh some 35
years ago, the historian Niharranjan Ray drew attention to urban Indian
perennial nostalgic romance towards Indian villages. This nostalgia, he
observed, "had been expressed since the 19th century in the literary
form in fiction and poety and in political form in the slogan 'back to
the villages'." He further said, "the curious aspect of the whole thing
is that with but few exceptions these writers and poets and these
nationalist leaders were all city dwellers, not villagers themselves,
not were they ever thinking of trekking back to the villages to live
there." [6]\

high-lightened same habit of his fellow economists at DSE: 'policies
formulated by those who do not know the difference between sowing and
reaping'. He had a line that field view and book view are two different
things. For instance see his classical contibution, "Social change in

[3] According to P. Sainath, "If the patriotism is the last refuse of an
scoundrel and 'what my reader wants' is the last refuse of an morally
and intellectually corrupt editor. This is what a  drug peddler would
say, "Hey I am decent guy. These assholes on the street want it what do
I do?" See

apparent to be discussed. After all, the largest selling Indian English
