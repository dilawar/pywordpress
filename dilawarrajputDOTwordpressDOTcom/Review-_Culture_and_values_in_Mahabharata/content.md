It is more than a mere commentary on characters of
Mahabharata.[/caption] Irawati was an anthropologist and she writes like
one. It is rare but not unusual for an anthropologists to mine classical
texts to gain some insight about a by-gone age. As an anthropologist,
she studied  structure of kinship in Mahabharata but in this book we are
for a different kind of treat. This work is her personal commentary on
some major characters in the epic. These commentaries and some other
essays on various themes  makes up this book under review , "Yugnata,
the end of an epoch". Karve's interests in Mahabharata were not merely
academic, she also enjoyed reading it. She took the critical edition of
Mahabharata as her primary source of the story. Critical edition was
produced at Pune Institute over three decades of painstaking work;
depending on the grammar and style of composition, verses  were
classified to be originally written or later interpolation .
Unfortunately, Mahabharata remains the only classical text which has
gone through such an exhaustive critical scrutiny. Why subtitle the book
"end of an epoch"? Karve judged the period of Mahabharata unique one in
Indian history; and with its end came the "yuga" or epoch to its end. In
Mahabharata, "values, gods and literature" are totally different from
what were to follow it. To make her point, she contrasted the attitude
of people in Mahabharata and later periods of Brahmin orthodoxy. One
sample is following,

> Before the Mahabharata, a teacher was always suppose to say to his
> people at the end, 'Whatever is good in me that alone should you
> imitate, nothing else.' But our saint poets like Dnyaneshwar, Tukaram
> or Ramdas advised a pupil to follow his teacher with blind devotion...
> The ancients daily prayed to the Sun, 'Keep our intellect always on
> the go like a horse whipped by the master.' How could the descendants
> of these very people be content to hand over their thinking powers
> into the keeping of guru?

In this short review, I can not write about her view on social norms
prevalent during the time of epic. One view should be enough to bring
out Karve's approach : compare and contrast. During the time of
Mahabharata, the relation between man and woman were less orthodox; the
ideal of a woman's loyalty to her husband differed from the later
period. Adoption almost never happened and a woman was free to have a
son from some other man if his husband demanded. This compulsion of
having son with this method of niyoga disappeared when method of
adoption replaced it. Along with it also disappeared the tolerance of
sexual laxity (or freedom, depending on the point of view) on woman's
part. Karve provides an example. Women who were rescued from the hands
of the enemy and perhaps used by them, were never abandoned and given
their former status on their return. This is in complete contrast to the
later one and to that of Modern Hindus who refused to accept their
rescued wives when they were brought back from Pakistan after riots of
1947.

Mahabharata is an unique piece of Indian literature. its realism of
human condition, its lack of sympathy for anyone, its refusal to paint
any super-human character, its lack of romanticism, and its refusal to
take side; all of them makes it an unusual piece of Indian literature.
There are no happily-ever-after. If happiness was gained, it was gained
after much sacrifice. What happed to our literature which came after it.
Karve tells us that the first dramatic theorist, Bharata, laid down the
rule that a play must not end tragically. Later dramatic stuck to this
rule so faithfully that even what was originally a tragedy, the
Ramayana, was made into a comedy. Much of the Sanskrit literature which
came after Mahabharata, such as Vikramamorvahiya and Skankuntalam, both
written by great Kalidasa, despite of unforgettable poetic beauty have
very banal endings.

What I personally like in Mahabharata is the absence of 
hero-worshiping, and Karve took pains to compare and contrast this with
the literature of bhakti-cult for which she has only contempt.  People
were people and relations among them were people-like. There was no
divine power changing fates. Later interpolation makes Arjuna a devotee
of Krishna; in original they are dear friends, she argues that no amount
of persuasion on Krishna's part could prevail upon Arjuna to kill the
two old men he had refused to kill. Gods in Mahabharata are Vedic or
Puranic. Even temples are not mentioned and hymns in the praise of
Shiva, the thousand sacred names of Vishnu and many names of the
Sun-god, are judged to be later interpolations.

Overall there are eleven essays in this book. In "Introduction", we are
given a crash-course on Mahabharata; and the oral tradition of narrating
it is explained. We are also told that there were more than one version
of this tale. One of orator was sympathetic to Kauravas , this one is
almost lost. Chapter 2, "The final effort" is commentary on the time
just before the war. The character of 'Bhisma' is under critical
scrutiny here. Had Bhisma accomplished anything in keeping his vows?

Next two chapters are on "Gandhari" and "Kunti" are written with unusual
sympathy, given that she is an anthropologist. She mentioned that the
chapter on Gandhari is not based on critical edition of Mahabharta;
perhaps Karve found some part of her in Gandhari. Next chapter "Father
and son?" is extremely interesting for the way the character of Vidura
is explained.  He was a Suta, illegal progeny of Kshatriya, higher in
status than Vaishya and Shudras but lower than Kshatriya and Brahmin. 
Suta is perhaps the first proto-typical  caste about which something is
written in ancient text. Next chapter is on Drupadi; it is longer than
others, partly because she represents "wives"  and had a complex and
whimsical personality; and majorly because much happened because of her.
At the end of this chapter, Karve shows us her literally imagination. It
wouldn't do without a sample,

> Draupadi heard a dragging sound, then a great sigh. Her whole body
> quivered with fear. She had been waiting quietly for the moment of her
> death. Was a wild animal coming? A hyena? In all the days of walking
> on the plateau they had seen no animals. Better that it fastened on
> her throat at once, with out mauling her. She closed her eyes hard. As
> she lay waiting for the unnamed danger to strike, suddenly a shadow
> fell over her eyes. A curtain had dropped between her and the sun. A
> low deep voice called, “Draupadi.” It was Bhima’s voice. It was he who
> had dragged himself, gasping with effort, over the ten, fifteen feet
> that separated them. On the way he had seen Arjuna, Nakula, and
> Sahadeva lying dead, and had thought Draupadi must be dead too. When
> Draupadi, frightened at his approach, had quivered, he had caught with
> joy this sign of life. “What can I do for you?” The words came out
> with difficulty. It was the same question he had asked all his life,
> but in this situation it was utterly meaningless and incongruous.
> Draupadi smiled. Bringing Bhima’s face close to hers, she said with
> her last breath, “In our next birth be the eldest, Bhima; under your
> shelter we can all live in safety and joy.

"The palace of Maya" talks about burning of Khandava and killing of most
of forests's animals. Why were all its birds, animals, and Nagas
destroyed? Did it go counter to Kshatriya code? What were the compulsion
behind it and was it morally acceptable to the norms and values of those
days? In the next chapter "Paramdharmo bhayavaha" (Taking over another's
dharma is dangerous), Karve is at her best. This chapter is about moral
codes, social norms and values. And there are few other things which a
social anthropologist can explain better. Next two chapters are on Karna
and Krishna; they do not paint the usual picture of these characters.
Krishna is not a god here. He is a mere human,  a great friends and a
responsible chieftain concerned about the fate of his people. His
transformation into a god during the later period is a paradox. Admirers
of Ramdhari Singh Dinker's "Rashmirathi" will be having some hard time
coming to term with her depiction of Karna.  The last chapter is the
central essay of this book, Yuganta, which can be read independently and
contains very rich arguments.

 "I read Mahabharta because I like it";  Karve gives this reason to his
reader for reading it. That is not completely true for those who knows
her work also know that she was driven by a acute desire to know "who we
were and what we have become". To figure this out, she took a keen
interest in anthropology.  And for the same reason she studied classical
text. But why write about Mahabharata for public then? Ms. Karve puts
here modest aim as following, "these essays are in a way an attempt to
make the younger generation understand my point of view. I shall
consider it a victory if they think that my interpretation is wrong and
read the Mahabharata just to prove it wrong".
