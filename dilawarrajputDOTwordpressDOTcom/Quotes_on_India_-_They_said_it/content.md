> thinking lie close to the surface; so the grasp of reality is
> relatively tenuous.**

> national symbol for India. **

-- D. D. Kosambi on Water Buffalo

> ** **

> and indifferent; whether they will be organised or disunited, bold or

> nation, rich or poor; strong and respected or weak and dominated by
> forward nations. Action, not sentiment, will be determining factor.**

-- M. Vishveswaraya, engineer, 1920

> ** ** **The Indian commitment to semantics of socialism is at least as
> deep as ours to the semantics of free enterprise... Even the most

> ** ** **“Hinduism hasn’t been good enough for the millions. It has
> exposed us to a thousand years of defeat and stagnation. It has given
> men no idea of contract with other men, no idea of the state. It has
> enslaved one-quarter of population and always left the whole
> fragmented and vulnerable. Its philosophy of withdrawal has diminished
> men intellectually and ill-equipped them to respond to challenges; it
> has stifled growth. So that again and again history has repeated
> itself: vulnerability, defeat, withdrawal.”**
> -- V. S. Naipaul

> **In India the choice could never be between chaos and stability, but
> between manageable and unmanageable chaos, between humane and inhumane
> anarchy, and between tolerable and intolerable disorder.**

> **Perhaps one is freer to be a scoundrel in India than elsewhere. So
> one was in the USA in the days of people like Jay Gould, when (in my
> opinion) there was more internal freedom in the USA than there is
> today. The 'disgusting subservience' of the others has its limits. The
> people of Calcutta riot, upset trams, and refuse to obey police
> regulations, in a manner that would have delighted Jafferson. I don't
> think their activities are very efficient, but that is not the
> question at issue.**

-- Haldane to Neyman, September 1961

> **Mimicking Oscar Wilde, one might say that the good Chinese and the
> good Indian, if they have lived a virtuous life, have now started
> going not to heaven, but to New York.**
