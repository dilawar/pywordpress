For last few decades, many scholars of Indian history have started to
argue, sometimes with official patronage, that [Indus
civilization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilization "Indus Valley Civilization")
was not only Aryan, but also Vedic or even post-Vedic. To make their
view credible they tried to prove, among other things, that the
'[Rigveda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigveda "Rigveda")' was composed
around 3500 BC, a date contemporaneous to with the Indus civilization.
Their opponents claim that these proponents usually reject the entire
method of dating by linguistics comparisons. Two enthusiasts even
invented the evidence by [forging an Indus
seal](http://www.flonnet.com/fl1720/17200040.htm). These deplorable
methods apart, the positive arguments advanced for a very early date of
the 'Rigveda' are two-fold : one based on river Sarasvati and other on
astronomical data. This note is about [Sarasvati
river](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarasvati_River "Sarasvati River").
For the matter of Indian astronomy, one  would benefit greatly by
reading the chapter titled 'Indian Calender' in the book 'Argumentative
Indians' by Prof. Amartya Kumar Sen. **The 'Lost River**'**of the
desert** [Meteorologists have
established](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12540924) that the
climate regime as we have today, with precipitation mainly deriving from
the monsoons, has prevailed since the onset of Holocene, the geological
epoch beginning about 10,000 years ago. It has been suggested, however,
that there have been hot and cold or dry and wet period within it. Much
of this speculation in regard to India is connected with what in 19th
century was identified as the problem of the 'Lost River' of the desert,
but is now often formulated as the question of Sarasvati river.

All rivers debouching into the plains between Sutlej and the
[Yamuna](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=31.0167,78.45&spn=0.1,0.1&q=31.0167,78.45%20(Yamuna)&t=h "Yamuna")
rise in the Siwaliks or the lower Himalyan slopes. They draw on rain-fed
drainage. These streams are tributaries of two major rivers, Chautang
and Ghaghar , both run dry well before they approach Thar desert of
western Rajasthan. As can be seen in the map, the Chautang's dry channel
runs westward from Haryana to Rajasthan and there it meets the dry
channel of the Ghagar, whose tributaries include the Sarsuti
(Sarasvati). This united channel runs further west into the district of
Bahawalpur in Pakistan, where, after a junction with another dry channel
coming from the north, it acquires the name of Hakra. The argument has
been advanced that in these dry channels of the Ghagar, Hakra and Nara,
we have traces of a continuous river identifiable as the Sarasvati
which, on the basis of Rigvediv verses, is held to have been a 'mighty
river' running into Rann of Kutch. It is claimed that this could happen
because Satluj and Yamuna, together or by turn, were its tributaries.
LAND-SAT satellite imagery has the reinforced the older suggestions,
based on ground field-work, the some old channels ran off present
courses of the Sutlej and Yamuna into the Hakra catchment area. Studies
of Gudwara and other salt lakes in Rajasthan by Gurdip Singh have
suggested that an earlier very arid phase ended after 12000 BC, and that
there was a sub-humid phase between 4420-2230 BC. During the later
phase, therefore, it is argued that there must then have been a higher
rainfall than today, and so with larger amounts of rain water to draw
on, the Saravati could have flowed as a great river in the humid phase.
Rigveda is a religious text and one should not neglect this aspect. All
religious texts contain mythological creatures and places. So if Rigveds
talks of a great river, then it is not impossible that it is talking of
a mythological or celestial river. Such mythological nouns are usually
praised or condemned in superlatives in religious texts. In the hymas of
Rigveda, Sarasvati is

> called '*naditama*, the best of the rivers' (Rv 2,41.16), which
> surpasses 'in majesty and might all other rivers' (Rv 7.95.2). It is
> 'fierce' (Rv 6.62.7), and 'swifter than the other rapid streams' (Rv
> 6.61.13). It 'comes onward with tempestuous roar' (Rv 6.61.8)
> 'bursting the ridges of the hills with its strong waves' (Rv 6.61.2).
> Sarasvati springs from a 'three-fold source' (Rv 6.61.12) in the
> mountains (Rv 7.95.2), and finally ends in a *samudra* (literally 'the
> gatherer of the waters' or sea) (Rv 7.95.2). It is a long river
> because many kings live on its banks (Rv 8.21.18) and the five tribes
> (Rv 6.61.12) derive their prosperity from it. It also has a number of
> tributaries; it is '*sindhu-mata*, the mother of rivers (Rv 7.36.6).
> It swells with rivers (Rv 6.52.6), said to be seven in number (Rv
> 6.61.12), Sarasvati being the seventh (Rv 7.36.6). Two rivers,
> Drishadvati and Apaya, are explicitly named in (Rv 3.23.4) in
> conjunction with Sarasvati. In addition, it is called '*sapta-svasa*',
> 'with seven sisters' (Rv 6.61.10). Another verse (Rv 8.54.4) speaks of
> Sarasvati and seven rivers (*Sapta-sindhavah*). These must be the
> 'seven mighty rivers' that 'seek the seas' (Rv 1.71.7). [1]

There are, however, number of objections to such a claim. One is based
on the facts of linguistics. 'Sarasvati' (modern of medieval 'Sarsuti')
is the name given since ancient times to a small rivulet which comes
from the Siwalik slopes and passes by Thanesar in Haryana. It thus is
unlikely that it may have been a great river by itself, like of other
great rivers originating from Himalayas. The name 'sarsuti' is not even
applied anywhere to the dry channels of the Ghaggar and Hakra. It is
likely that if Sutlej or Yamuna ever flowed into these channels then
they collectively would have been called by this name. Moreover,
Yamuna's runs in much deeper bed than its earlier higher terraces on its
west bank. The rise of Shivalik mountains was the reason of Yamuna's
eastward migration. Some believes that Yamuna would not have flowed into
Ghaggar basin within at-least ten thousands years. If we agree that
there were larger amount of rainfall untill 2030 BC (a fact not firmly
establised by any means as similar study of the Pachpadra salt basin has
shown), then we can explain how the present dry Hakra channels were
carved out. But does it make Saraswati a mightier river which carried
proportionally larger amount of water than other snow-fed Himalayan
river? Because if rainfall was higher than other rivers would have
carried proportionally larger amount of water gathered from their own
far extensive catchment area and they could have flowed into Hakra
channel by themselves. So if one mighty river was not dried out why
water does not flow in Hakra channel? One explanation is based on man's
handiwork without invoking great climate change. Man has cleared a large
amount of forest and scrubs and undermined the retentive power of soil.
With the reduction of green cover, level of rainfall was also decreased.
Moreover, as long as three to four thousand years, 'bunds' have been set
up on the streams and flood channels of eastern Punjab and Haryana in
order to divert water for irrigation. This may have shut off the water
supply to Hakra. There is a sound thesis in defense of Sarasvati being a
celestial rather than a earthly river. In this context, it does not mean
the modern Thanesar stream going by the name of Sarsuti, but the Indus
or even the Arghandab-Helmand (Avestan Harakhvaiti = Sarasvati, the 's'
of Sanskrit changing into 'h/kh' of Avestan) in Afganistan. Many rivers
are often given the same name : compare the Ghaggar, into which Sarsuti
flows, and the Ghaghara of Uttar Pradesh plains, a large Himalyan river;
or, again Sind, that is the Indus, and the small river in Kashmir and
central India bearing the same name. Nonetheless, the later portions of
Rigveda, especially in the River Hymn in Book X, the Sarasvati does seem
to correspond to the modern Sarasvati, for that hymn places it between
Yamuna and the Sutudri or Sutlej. But then here there is no indication
of its great size or even sanctity, and the Sindhu or Indus is praised
in same high terms as the Sarasvati is in verses elsewhere. END NOTES :
