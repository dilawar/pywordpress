India is a funny land, I always like to argue. In fact so funny that
sometimes it seems to be exasperating. When it comes to irony, nothing
matches India. This is a land where temporary arrangements are most
permanent (reservation, schedule 9 etc). This is also a land which have
a rising economy 8-10% though creating jobs at 1%. It has second most
number of billionaire still 80% of her population lives below Rs 20 a
day. The most global city of her is in news in for localisms and blah
blah...\
\
But that is not what I meant to write today. I keep an eye on gender
issues, mostly in India. The position of women is India is also
ironical. Sometimes they are worshiped as goddess, and most of time
otherwise. The [current gender inequality and hunger in
India](http://www.thp.org/where_we_work/south_asia/india/research_reports/chronic_hunger_and_status_of_women)
is a matter of concern for every public spirited Indian.\
\
[Lets get to the
point](http://www.littlemag.com/pdf/contents-venusenvy.pdf). In hindu
religion, there are lot of goddess (devi). Prominent are three. But they
are not [central deity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Goddess). In
spite of their power, knowledge and wealth, they had been married (or
denied individuality in letter and spirit) to the three gods, the
trinity. [Not in Vedas, but later after
Vedanta](http://www.flipkart.com/god-woman-merlin-stone/015696158x-apw3fnvhfe).
 Perhaps, that did not serve the purpose
of*[Manuvadi](http://hinduism.about.com/library/weekly/aa051303a.htm)*.
A fearsome, uncontrolled *devi* were to be a *biwi,*an uncontrolled
power had to be subjugated. They made a morality out of it.[Indus
civilization has some sort of central
deity](http://www.svabhinava.org/Dialogues/SarasvatiUnicorn/index.php).
Since Indus script is still un-deciphered its hard to say exactly how
these deity were treated, whether they were total independent or
considered as 'the other half'.\
\
Perhaps world could have been better off in gender-equality if the deity
were left only *devi*and the the status of *Biwi* could be an additional
one . One should be attached with the least number to identities. It
makes life harder to create an identity for oneself otherwise.\
