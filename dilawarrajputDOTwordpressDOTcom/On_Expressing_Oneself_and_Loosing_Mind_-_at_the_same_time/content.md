Apparently I am loosing my mind........\
\
Second time...\
\
First time It was claimed when I watched "American Pie". Why? It was my
first movie in color. Must have been a cultural shock for a village
yokel. I was just fresh out of my village. Never traveled so far away
from my home. Never by train. Never seen a tube-light before (only bulbs
and that's too in the nearby town).. Indeed, it was my first encounter
with the modern world, as it is believed.\
\
But this time, it is not because of cultural shock. It is because I have
been expressing myself more openly and, in fact, in the way I should not
be. Its time to revisit.....\
\
Once one of my room-mate was saying, "Its easy to go on a Date in
Kolkata, But having sex in almost impossible." I remarked, "In my
village, You can have sex but it is impossible to go on a Date."\
\
Then there were Lolz.......\
\
It is pleasingly easier situation than any of the situations I have seen
in 'American Pie' and you could expect that a guy coming from that
sexual-liberated society not to loose his mind (pun intended).  There is
a knowledge for you, "*If you see sugarcane fields in any Village, sex
is as easy as making money in this world.* *Ever wonder why Kamdev's bow
is made of Sugarcane*!!" As Mark Twain once said, "You need not to be
smart for making money, You just have to know how to make money.([See,
chapter on poverty and
inequality](http://beta.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/article109881.ece))"
That holds in the case of Sex also. I never fit in my village, neither
in this modern world.\
\
But I am concerned with this time loosing-mind. When I first took on
Times of India, one of my FB-friend confronted. Never by giving any
references but by '*I think*' and '*Hindu padhke tu chutiya gaya hai
Gaonwale, ye leftist paper hai.*" Once he even commented that "*look at
you, talking all this, want to run away from real problems and want to
do a Ph.D.*" Perhaps He did not like the tone of it and deleted it to
replace it with more neutral comment. Comment which appeared on my
Facebook page did not contain these damning words. He might be oblivious
to the fact that Facebook sends an email every time you submit a
comment. That indeed is great problem with online publishing. It can not
be undone once you've done it. One must be careful about his/her
privacy. Second time, when I blog my [open letter to riches/would be
riches of this
great-nation](http://dilawarsays.blogspot.com/2009/11/open-letter-to-richeswould-be-riches-of.html),
He commented, "*Why don't you become a richie*" and then again, He
deleted it.  Few days ago I was confronted again first with an advise
and then, when I pushed him more, by harsh words. But this person had
always been very polite.\
\
This calls for why people who are generally do not have express opinion
in public become so much disturbed that they make it a personal
confrontation rather than a cool-headed debate on general issue. I admit
that I am the first one who try to make it a personal issue and then
backs off from all of these. For two reasons, one, taking it personally
will trouble my thinking process and I'll spend a significant time to
counter-argue him/her rather than worrying about general picture.
Second, without hurting someone sentiments you can not get what one
really thinks.\
\
So why people get pissed off! Consider a child. Just criticize his/her
parents in front of him/her, (s)he will get angry whether (s)he is able
to retaliate is other issue. Now this child grows up and starts making
fun of same parents but if you criticize his/her girlfriend/boyfriend,
(s)he might get really pissed off. You might always be right. The issue
is identity. First parents were his/her identity. This child is known by
their name. In college, His identity is a separate one from their
parents so He does not have to protect this identity which contribute
nothing to his. His girlfriend now forms a significant part of his
identity, He has to protect it for he no longer known as Mr. X but by
the '*setting*' of  Ms Y. The time He is out of his college, She no
longer an identity of His (or vice versa) And we see a lot of breaking
ups after college and starts doubting whether love does exist. These
cases happens mostly after marriage. A wife is not as strong identity as
a girlfriend even though she is called as '*Ardhangini*' - the other
half. So protecting the part of identity your wife which contributes to
yours is not an issue.  But you can not hurt your girlfriend as openly.
The dynamics of identity in this relationship is still evolving and had
been shaped by rather more liberal point of view. Its not to say that
GF's are not physically abused by BF's.[But in India this problem is not
as adverse as it is in
UK](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2009/sep/01/teenage-sexual-abuse-nspcc-report).
Or perhaps we have to see it since there are relatively very few teens
in those situations in ALL OF THE INDIA. \
\
In fact, a stronger identity of one's wife threatened a men's identity.
When Sita (in Ramayana) was able to lift a bow which was so heavy,
Janaka, He father, fainted. Not because he was awestruck by the sheer
strength of his daughter but by the fact that she might not be able to
get married. From where He could find a groom stronger than her. A man
should be stronger than his wife? That was an identity of a men in those
day and still is. A female boxer can only marry a man boxer. And if one
do not do that, there will be jokes.  In these days, A man should earn
more than his wife? It is a modern identity of man. When this identity
is threatened, you see some ridiculous cases coming out in public. It
roughly translated into ego-clash. So you see a highly-educated girl or
a girl earning much either single of marrying someone who by the way is
not interested in her capabilities. A normal man (the most prominent
species these days) would not like the idea having stronger wife (both
physically or  monetary). But one might not be having problem of the
girl is stronger in ethics, character, morals, compassion for they are
not valued in the '*Markets of Society*'. So you see people giving
advice to girls not to become IAS for after that they can only marry an
IAS. What a fucking stupid world I came to born in! It must have been
made by a force who had the very sarcastic sense-of-humor. More
sarcastic than Chandler Bing. \
\
Next time you want to make a guy/girl pissed off. Just figure out
his/her identity and attack it. \
\
The lame Hindus who never confronted and fight the foreign powers with
the identity 'Indian' showed remarkable '*veerta*' in burning, raping
and maiming helpless Muslims in Gujrat when they felt that their 'hindu'
identity is threatened. Same is true with Muslims and Americans. [Its
not a clash of civilizations as it appears as the title of this link, it
is the clash of
identities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clash_of_Civilizations).
You can abuse India in front of mostly Indians and came out without a
black eye, just try to do it with 'Hiduism' or "Muslism' etc. Once a guy
in my hostel (H9 -Pluto, IITB) thrashed another guy who was constantly
criticizing Indian cricket team when It was loosing. Amazingly the guy
was Bengali who are generally very soft.\
\
So a market-worshiper identity is threaten when some-one preach equality
and so gets a flak for it. Same is with the TOI and HT, if you love this
newspaper, you see the world as they want to show you. They make you
take pride in those papers with all the emotional campaign (mostly on
the anniversaries) and hence they form a part of your identity in you.
To make argument you start, 'in TOI that day'. A much more subtle and
less biased version could be, "have you read P. Sainath published in The
Hindu yesterday?" That is the difference between ardent Hindu and and
ardent TOI reader[1]....\
\
 In India, the land I work in to make a living, has a peculiar habit. If
something is going wrong in your house with you and wrong-doers are the
members of your family, you are not suppose to make noise for it might
disturb the neighbor. All izz well, you must be chanting all the time.
And if you speak (just like Arundhati Roy) you are confronted with a
tempting argument "Its easy to figure out a problem rather than solving
it."\
\
Once Prof H Narayan in one of the assignment gave us a problem. The
problem was, in fact, that we have to come up with a problem, explore
it, understand it and try to find out a solution.(with a waring to me,
*You are creative but you also have to right).* Just try do it yourself.
An hours passed, and I was looking at my paper and thinking of the song,
'*Mera jeevan kora kagaj, kora hi rah gaya."*(My life was a blank paper,
as it remains so.)\
\
In our life almost all of the problems -if you look closely - are made
by someone else, say peer pressure which I found so much on the students
of IIT-B, surely they have extra-human capabilities to sustain these
identities all along. I could not do that, just cant!!). Why you need a
solution if you can stop a problem when It was evolving. You never had
to solve this economic crisis had the regulation was in place. But the
process of creating a problem is 'profitable' for some, and all people
are not blind. They speak and try to point out that your are creating a
problem. But these '*educated' * people have to remove this obstacle. So
they came out with this statement. How intelligent! "***The only thing
they know is crib and question! Its easier to question and be a question
rather than to find or be a solution !***" So be quiet when we are
making a problem, then you can criticise and solve it while we busy
ourselves to make one more (sure there is supply and demand).\
\
The rabble rouser!! If you a management students then you might be
hearing these days, even in [Harward Review of
Busines](http://hbr.org/)s, that for an organization to work well, they
are indeed necessary. A modern approach to management.\
\
But why people criticize? We all know that the most prominent use of
language is to influence others. We all do it in some way or other.
Sending 'sms', 'emails', letters, posting links, tweets, blogs, in one
form or other are only to influence others, and in this process, making
others to realize that  we do exist, even only on Social Networking
Sites.\
\
\
Foreground and background can never have same pattern! You may call them
'dissidents', 'assholes', 'some -ist, -ism' or whatever. They would
never like status-quo. And whatever significant ever came out in this
world, it came out through these guys. \
\
\
Indeed, Who would not like to live in foreground? This is as tempting as
for most of us, money is, power is, peace is, happiness is. They are not
much complex. That deserve another blog.\

END NOTES:\
1. Irony, though the name of this newspaper is TheHindu, it hated
Narandra Modi in particular and mocked at BJP almost all the time. True,
Left criticism is not there, but for that you can refer to Indian
Express. Or a better picture another estimable newspaper 'The Telegraph'
of Kolkata. When Left loose in Bengal, TOI was so happy deliberately and
quite dumbly says that people had enough of leftism. The picture is to
whom they lost, Mamta who is more opposite to neo-liberal policies. In
fact She represents Leftism in its most darning force but in another
wrapper. But an enemy is lost to a person who has same colors -only more
saturated - and it is time to celebrate. \
