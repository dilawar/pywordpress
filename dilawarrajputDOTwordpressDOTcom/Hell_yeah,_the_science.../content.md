  Somehow, even being trained as an engineer, I could appreciate
something in science!\
\
It all begin in my childhood in a same way It begins in every Indians
childhood. The pretty stories about science and the wonder of its. But
you have to grow up to depreciate *this*science which has taken roots in
*folklores*.\
\
In our most reputed university, by common consent, Indian Institute of
Science, there is a Center for Sustainable Technologies, known as ASTRA
(Application of Science and Technologies for Rural Area). It is a
curious irony that the abbreviation came out be of destructive meaning!
One institute in India which is now in news for all the wrong reasons
these days is "Department of Atomic Energy" established in India by Homi
Bhabha with the extraordinary support of Nehru. I am going to talk about
two scientist, one is physicist and other is a chemist. Both were
Banglorian, fellow alma-matters of London. Both of our men, physicists
and the Chemists, had the deep and enduring commitment to their
homeland. He went to study abroad when the our university were fledgling
and came back after earning their degree. Neither of them had to wait to
listen to *"ye jo desh hai tera"* or had to watch the more illustrious
and longer version of this song, the movie, "*Swadesh"*for realizing
what is better for them. Whether they should build their own institutes
or market themselves in the bazaars of West?\
\
Well, they came back and yet trod on the diagonally opposite paths. One
went to produce bombs in the disguise of making atomic energy (DAE has
achieved 10% of atomic energy what Bhabha had promised!) other went to
make technology for masses while naming his center after a *thing* which
is well qualified for the synonym of destruction.While one of them
devoted his life to the greater cause for glorifying Indian state, other
chose to bend it to the service of the Indian Villager - those damn-ugly
trouble-making lesser mortals.   \
\
Another center with more-or-less same values is in IIT bombay which,
curiously and interestingly has the pleasing name "CITARA". A dim and
twinkling but still a star.\
  \
But how come only one of them could become our hero? Yes, I am talking
about Raja Ramana. He is known in India as the father of Indian Nuclear
program and respected in Pakistan for preventing nuclear war. Our
chemists is however known as AKN Reddy. Once he was documented by
someone to remark, "*Developing countries must not and will not allow
themselves to be distracted from the imperatives of economic development
and growth by the illusory dream of an atmosphere free from smoke or a
landscape innocent of chimney stacks."* Meanwhile some prominent voices
in the West were boasting, *"Smoke is an indication of work . . .
therefore, we are proud of our smoke."

I don't want to comment about Copenhagen!\

Anyway, coming forward to my time, We are hearing a lot of Nuclear
Energy. Pacts signed by India and US, India and France, India and
Russia. Some to supply reactors, others to supply fuel. The assessments
of this trade had been done only by DAE or the vulgar cheerleaders of
bombs. DAE, being the most secretive organization in India is hard to
trust. I go along with the simple notion, "If something is not
accountable and transparent it could be anything but science." I forgot
who coined this line! Anyway, our cheerleaders who are generally known
the euphemism 'Defense Expert' write in almost all of our Newpapers,
more or less repeating the same lines, "BUILD BOMBS, LARGER BOMBS,
BETTER BOMBS, GOOD BOMBS, PATRIOT BOMBS, SMART BOMBS, ......." They
never wield a gun but somehow, in the most active corner of their
intellect, seem to be thinking about how to kill fellow humans. They
tell to tax-payers, "This is the price you have to pay for your
security." While the *dushman* of the nation can create havoc with their
second world war kind of weapons.. Even in US, their tactics were of
pre-Nuke times. Too much to spend on this never-to-be-used technology,
and worse if ever-to-be-used and no-one-is-left-to-remember
consequences. Ha! Are you kidding, they can not be that destructive!
Writing in[indiatogether.org ](http://indiatogether/)Ramachandra Guha
insinuates that DAE is well qualified for a moral and financial scandal
which can put Bofors and our petty politicians in shades! Ha, too much
for our beloved BARC, which hosts best of our intelligent brains who are
yet to figure out why two students were charred to death in one of his
laboratory. Its time DAE starts producing its own X-Files.\
\
APJ Kalam is well known but who knows Laurie Baker, a Keralite, an
architecture who saved crores of rupees by his artful designs.
Fortunately He has an article about him on Wikipedia,
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie\_Baker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Baker),
while out chemist is not known even on Wiki. Probably Bakers,
British-born tag! What you say? Brown skin.. rubbing fair-and-handsome
on your hated-skin!! Are you worth it too?\
\
On this new year, lets explore other possibilities.. That serving our
own motherland could be as rewarding in some sense as selling ourselves
in Western bazaars (Yes I don't have a global vision, till any farmer is
committing suicide or worse anyone is sleeping hungry in my own
motherland.) .. That our career can not longer is significant in DRDO or
DAE, CTARA or ASTRA can be our dreamed destinations too.. That we can
learn from Baker as much as We can learn from Bhabha or Kalam.. That the
path of Reddy is as significant as the path of Ramanna.. That a paper
pencil research (pure research) is not a sin to commit in our poor
nation.. That a weapon is disgraceful, even it is the most powerful and
own by us!\
\
I myself sure dont want to see my generation becoming a generation in
which only power/market/bombs worshiper are only afloat as role models.
One may tell one story! Andre. a character in Bertolt Bretch's *Galileo*
remarks that 'Unhappy is the land where there is no heroes'. To this
Galileo responds: 'No, Unhappy the land that needs heroes.' I can not
understand whom I should agree with!\
\
With all these jewels lying around, Do we have to worship anyone from
land-far-away whoes name is somewhat Indian? And of-course, No scientist
can not be great who ever posed happily in military uniform after
knowing the significance of what He had done!\
