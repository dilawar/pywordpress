The French political theorist Alexis de Tocqueville, who was the great
observer of man's affairs, while witnessing the birth of democracy in
America, thought that the age of democracy will be the age of
mediocrity. There will be a dead level plane of achievement in almost
every kind of activity. A democratic person, due to various reasons he
explains lucidly, does everything in hurry. He is always satisfied with
"pretty well" and does not pause for an instance to think what he is
doing. "His curiosity is at once insatiable and cheaply satisfied; for
he cares more to know a great deal quickly than to know anything well:
he has no time and but little taste to search things to the bottom". To
make matter worse, "men of democracy worship chance, and are much less
afraid of death than of difficulty". Despite his strong attachment to
democracy, Tocqueville took great pains to point out what he thought to
be a negative side of democracy: it will be an unheroic age. Tocqueville
maintained that there wont be heroes in democratic societies because
democracies are inherently incapable of producing them. But modern
democracies were not able to do without heroes and this was also
foreseen by Tocqueville with much misgivings. He believed, rightly or
wrongly, that unlike aristocracy, there will not be a proper place for
heroes or hero-worshipers in democracies, and when they arose they would
sooner or later turn into despots. Modern democracy may or may not do
without heroes but they certainly can not do without leaders. And in
this modern age, which breeds them in great profusion, the problem is to
know what to do with them. Democracies are no longer restricted to
Europe or United States. They are in many parts of world in their own
peculiar forms. They have acquired some distinct features of the
societies in which they were able to grow. All human societies value
heroes or charismatic personalities but some among are always more
obsessed with them. People seems to somewhat tired of their politicians
but it is not like that people are tired for charisma; it only moves
from politics to other area of public life. People reserve their praise
and transfer their adulation for movie starts, sadhus and sants,
sports-personalities and sometimes, for man of sciences. The charismatic
people from various fields have been using their charisma in politics.
Some have been quite successful. NTR missed becoming the prime minister
of India, Imran Khan is trying the same in Pakistan. The appeal of
charisma, by which I mean the personal quality that secure instant and
unquestioned devotions to the leader of his followers, is in decline
everywhere. Not only there is no Nehru today, there is no de Gaulle and
Winston Churchill. The consideration of this for the prospect of
democracy and health of its institutions deserves some attention. --
