I just love the concept of feedback, negative in particular. It makes
lifestable and every system whatsoever. Its just not about system
engineering or anyother discipline, it is pervasive in every aspect of
your life and mine too, ofcourse. Consider a simple example, quite
interesting and relevant, a girl and aboy fall in love with each other,
they started giving compliments to each other,giving each other best of
their criticism. Thats nothing but a positivefeedback. I can not draw a
figure here, otherwise it could be more lucid. Now,one starts loving
other more, that in itself is positive feedback, its increasethe love of
the other person for the first one. Here we got a loop, just like incase
of astable multi-vibrator. This 'love-system' now reaches its maximum
valueafter a time when the response of each person saturates. This is
due to themental and physical capabilities of the each individuals. You
don't have to beKurt Godel to figure out that when a system is running
at its full capacity, itbound to be collapsed. The time it takes to
collapse depends on the variousaspects of the individuals, these
aspects, lets call them components of thesystem. Maturity, level of
compromising nature, level of ego, etc could betermed as the
characteristics of these components which sets the time limit ofthis
collapse. But for sure, it will collapse. That what happen in the
lovemarriages where there a loop is established of positive nature. For
sustaining arelationship, there is a vital need of negative feedback,
though it induce manyparameters which in turn degrade short term
performance. Initially it mayfacilitate large settling time ( which in
our system of interest is strength ofrelationship) if feedback
coefficient is high. So make sure, negative feedbackcoefficient should
be small enough, otherwise your system is not going to givethe desired
output, and hence no question of stability. Well i have to perfectthis
theory, right now i am feeling hungry, gotta go for dinner.\
This theory can be applied to homosexual too. I am not sex biased!\
Don't forget to give your "negative feedback" about this blog.\
