Post office is located at the end of the IIT Bombay campus. My inland
letters were finished, I went there to buy them. To enter this PO,
either you first get out of the IIT Y-point and then get into it or you
can jump over a four feet wall. I took the easy step. I jumped in.\
\
After I bought the letters and came out, three guys were waiting for me
outside. They were of course harsh and the worst form of *Marathi
Manoos*I'd ever came across. Much better than a normal Haryanvi Jat by
the way. They took my id card and asked me to collect is from Dean,
Student Affair. It happened two days before Dussera 2009.\
\
After the Dussera holiday, I'd go to the Dean SA. I saw the name which
sounded like a South Indian. I was relieved. I thought that now there
are more chances that this guy will listen to me before making up his
mind. But I was wrong about it. He was another *Marathi Manoos.* After
giving me lecture in Marathi on how a person from UP should behave and
Thakerey is out there to break my leg, he said the four letter f-word.
Yes, you are right!  Fine. "*What kind of fine?"* I asked. "*Monetary".
Rs 1000.*I bit my nails and another four letter f-word appears in my
mind. Fuck! But I did not argue with this pig-head, a quality which is
admired in India, it was reduced to Rs 500.\
\
Regionalism is seen in India in one form or other. What he said was not
depressing or frustrating. You can see the success of Shiv Sena or MNS
over there, it speaks a lot about this *cosmopolitan*city. I think
politicians as the applied-social-scientist who tell people what they
like to hear. This issue was not worth thinking about. What I catches my
mind was the four letter f-word. Fine.\
\
I have the habit of paying fine. Late submission of library books is the
most prominent. I don't feel bad about it, neither I've met one who
feels bad about it. The library fine is quite low, Rs 0.50. The library
cards also has an additional line mentioning that, "*Someone else might
be waiting for it.*" Had there be no fine, would I submit my books on
time (why? We'll see) . [I used to wonder. Then a study in Haifa, Israel
came to approve my
apprehensions.](http://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/gneezy/docs/fine.pdf)\
\
 To quote this link\
"The deterrence hypothesis predicts that the introduction of a penalty
that leaves everything else unchanged will reduce the occurrence of the
behavior subject to the fine. We present the result of a field study in
a group of day-care centers that contradicts this prediction. Parents
used to arrive late to collect their children, forcing a teacher to stay
after closing time. We introduced a monetary fine for
late-coming parents. As a result, the number of late-coming parents
increased significantly. After the fine was removed no reduction
occurred. We argue that penalties are usually introduced into an
incomplete contract, social or private. They may change the information
that agents have, and therefore the effect on behavior may be opposite
of that expected. If this is true, the deterrence hypothesis loses its
predictive strength, since the clause ‘‘everything else is left
unchanged’’ might be hard to satisfy." 
\
In this study, they put fine on the parents who came late to pick up
their child from the day-care centre. The common wisdom might have
predicted that this would improve the situation but in fact the numbers
of the parents turning up late increased significantly. The fine was not
small as in case of IITB library fine. But interestingly when the fine
was removed, the situation did not improve. In other words, imposing
fine has worsened the attitude of parents.
\
Why??
\
The study concludes that, 
\
Any model, or explanation, of these results has to provide two
specific predictions: first, the fact that the rate of delay increases
after the introduction of a fine; second, the fact that this rate
remains stable after the fine is removed.\
\
They further concluded that  a ‘‘large enough’’ fee would eventually
reduce the behavior. For instance, many day-care centers in the United
States clearly announce a fee for coming late at the start of the year,
and this fee is large and proportional to the length of the delay.
\
Lets come to the point. First it was a social norm, coming late and
making the manager waiting made them feel bad. It was an ethical
situation. After the invention of fine. It became the market norm like
you are buying their services. There is no more dilemma of ethics. Buy
why the situation has not improved after removing the fine?
\
Perhaps when social-sense ( [harm, fairness, community (or group
loyalty), authority and
purity](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/magazine/13Psychology-t.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all))  is
replaced by market-sense (supply-demand, game-theory, cost-benefit
analysis); its hard to reverse the situation. [So fine becomes a
fees](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/feb/23/brain-food-fines-and-fees).
\
So if there was no fine in IIT Bombay library, I could have been more
sensitive towards the idea that other are waiting for it. Had they
removed the fine later, I don't think I could have done the same. 
\
May be few things make sense only in one language (English) as Balram
Halwai says in the opening gambit of the novel "The White Tiger" writing
to Chinese premier. So you see young girls and guys taking pride in
their "market oriented thinking", in Hindi translation, it is just
downright "bazaru". A very derogatory remark for anyone, boy or girl. It
oscillate between selling one's soul to selling one's body.
\
Replacing the sense of responsibility with idea of money needs careful
studies. Taxpayers (I am also one of those) generally feel this way, "I
have paid the taxes, its government job now to take social
responsibility." Once these ideas become a philosophy, you see the same
kind of behaviour as this study has shown. In relationships also, these
things are creeping in. Career and Family? Who's job to take care of
child? Relations or career? Sorry, this was just professional and many
more. In all of these cases, the conflict is always between  social norm
and market norm.
\
First impression, I dont like the way world is moving. Do you?
