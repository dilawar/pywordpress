\
I was a M.Tech
([*Matka*](http://dilawarsays.blogspot.com/2010/03/on-matka-m-tech-iit-bomaby.html))
in IIT Bombay during 2007-2009. These are few accounts of this life. \
\
HOSTEL 9\
\
I stayed, all of my time during my post-graduation, in Hostel-9, Room No
133. In second year, masters student usually change their hostel to 12,
13 or 14. I did not like those big hostels. Hostel 9 [is named 'Pluto'
which was stripped of its planetary designation in solar
system](http://www.iitb.ac.in/students/hostel9.html) when I was spending
my time there. That made me feel little sad. The illuminated sign-post
which had the words 'Hostel - 9' on it was, over time, reduced to 'Hot
el -9' .. 'Ho  el -9' ..'H    -9'. and finally to .... The biggest
plundering happened when guys from IIT-R stayed there during Inter-IIT
sports meet. From 'Hostel 9' to 'Ho tel 9' was done by us but from 'Ho
tel' to nothing was someone else's deed.\
\
Since 2007 hostel 9 has seen a colossal increase of *Matka*s. This was
visible when 'T-Shirts designs' were put-up for voting and the
best-design was choosen had up-votes were only from '*Matkas*'. In early
morning, a comment was there on the paper, '*Tatti, ek bhi B.Tech. nahi
hai list main'.*\
\
This hostel is small and old. My room was on ground floor and the
Monsoon could be very rewarding and irritating at the same time. After
every rain you can see few crabs fightening each other. One of them
would grab a stick and run like hell for his hole. Few crows would come
and do a lethal 'beack-work' on tiny crabs. Sometime a crab would appear
in your room, take a tour and then disappear from the same door. The
lizard was also a curious animal sitting at a same place like a
philosopher and getting fatter day by day making 'tic - tic' sound in
the night.\
\
The canteen is run by Raghu. I used to buy apple and bournvita milk
mostly. Whenever I could meet Gaurav, we'd buy tea and then go to his
room and watch some animation or some 'god-movie'. One day, Raghu gave
me a gift, a CD of animation movie of '[Paddle
Pop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l1_nfgCQk4)', apparently a
ice-cream saving super hero.  I watched it in Vaibhav Room and Bally'd
comment, "*Kitna enthu hai inhe animation ka, CD la la kar dekhte hai.
LAN par nahi mila kya?"*\
\
After a year, when my room-mate departed to H-13, my room was only to be
knocked at election time. Seeing me lying on bed almost exhaused they'd
smile and would say, 'Final year?" "Yes, Matka Max.." That would
increase their grin. Running away from them was the hardest thing to do.
I missed my room mate on those occasions. He had the quality of getting
interested in these kind of stuff. Elections in IITB are somewhere
between the Indian General Election and JNU's elections.\
\
H9 had a pool table on which I played rarely and a nice small badminton
court, on which i'd never played. Some small small programms were always
there, but *matkas* hardly take part in them and I was not a different
pattern.\
\
DEPARTMENT\
\
[Electrical Engineering department i](http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/)s
considered the best EE department in India. I was in microelectronics
group about which Prof Vasi commented in *physical electronics* class,
"*There was a time that we found it very hard to find jobs for our
graduates, now  most of you have come here for good jobs.*" These days
it is happening in Nuclear Technology and may be IIT Kanpur - Nuclear
technology would be the next hot-shot.\
\
This dept has some stalwarts, Prof. HN (networks), Prof Vasi (cmos),
Prof DKS (as a teacher - vlsi and embedded), Prof MPD (VLSI design and
embedded system), Prof Gadre ('Bhims Pitahmah of signal processing', My
co-guide remark), Prof Agashe (Control systems, physics, funde).. Prof
Lal (in Analog design , now left), Prof VRR (nano-tech, dept. expansion,
PR), Prof S Chaudhary (image processing) and very promising young
faculty members.\
\
Few department in IITB uses all of its facilities as they are used by EE
dept.\
\
DKS & being a  DUCKLING\
\
[Prof Dinesh Kumar
Sharma](http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/dinesh), DKS, pronounced
DuKS is a remarkable man, ask any on his students. His students are
known as Ducklings. A man of rare energy and enthusiasm; and of course
has a loud voice. If you dissect him, you surely will find a small
nuclear reactor inside him. That kind of energy can not come from food
he eats. He doesn't need a loudspeaker in class but uses one; passes
some of the most witty comments is the class and ask his class that
atleast 20% of them should come back to IIT. I've never taken his class
and yet He was my guide for M.Tech project.\
\
After chossing 'Artificial Retina' for my PG thesis, I met him. His room
was utterly unkempt. A lot of papers and books on his table and you can
only see his face over this table - '*chasa and smile*'. He is a small
man, a Ph.D. from TIFR which has the history of producing some of the
brightest scholars. He asked me for a small presentation before my
seminar. I'd prepared one and met him after a week. Actually the
presentation was scheduled after 3 days of our first meeting at 2:00 pm
but VLSI lab PC's clock was not correct. When I went to his room he was
leaving for another meeting, He saw me and said, "*Kya hua bhool gaye
the, ab to main busy huin, maine 3 din baad same time par rakha hai. Is
baar mat bhulna varna maar padegi.*"\
\
During the presentation there were only He and me. I did not cite the
source of an image and He commented on this, "*tum aisa hi karoge to
tumhari gand fat jayegi."* Did I hear him right? I still doubt it. I was
really surprised. He was smiling seeing my face which generally does not
reveal feelings. I said, "Ok, I'll keep this in mind."\
\
When DKS is in presentation, you should be damn sure of what you are
talking about. The quality of presentation is best maintained when he is
around. If anyone of IIT-B is reading this, try to get him in your
presentation.\
\
He walks very fast, and its really hard to catch him.While you walking
with him discussing something, he'd walk slowly so you can keep up with
him, almost in zig-zag fashion, just like a child with his mother. He
never uses lifts and does not use A.C. of his office. Reason is simple
and very profound. I got it this way. In EE-Annex NanoE facilities ACs
always keep entrance of EE-Anex cool, when we entered , He would remark
that this is really relieving from his hot-humid HOD office. On which
I'd ventured, "But there is an AC in your office?" "*Yes there is, but
there is no A.C. for every faculty, This is my satyagraha and I cant use
it till there is AC for every faculty."*He made me feel so small but
that did not prevent me to switch on AC in CHAR2-Lab.\
\
He wanted to see the poster I had made for INUP. After seeing my poster,
there was a comment, "*Why this comment, 'The figuere is showing'....
Consider this 'I am having three children'.. what does this mean?....
Either I am in the process of making three children or I am eating three
children.... Make is 'figure shows'......"* And I burst into laughter.\
\
Few small small things happened midway. Sometimes he'd say, "*Tum uchak
kar aa jaate ho, pahle details ko work out kar liya karo..."* and
*"Arrey baba, I am also from same background.. unhe lagta hai PhD karna
nautanki hai.. Get your degree, get a job, get married, have a family,
this is a pretty picture!! But pretty pictures do not soothe
everyone." *When I was talking about financial problems my parents are
citing for not letting me go for to Ph.D.*" *\
\
Then there was placement time. "*What is happning in your placements."
"Getting shortlisted, but can not control my mouth..." "Seekho yaar,
bolna chalna... Hero bano.. :-)". "Un logo ne [my current company] phone
kiya tha  tumhare barein main, maine khoob tarif kar di hai, meri lutiya
mat duba dena waha.. :-D"*This I told him NS who talked with DKS before
confirming my offer. He laughed and said, "*Haan, tareef to unhone bahut
kee thi. IITB ke sare pschyco hote hai kya."* "*Tum IITD wale lafango se
to theek hi hote hai.. :-)"*I replied to him. NS is happy I joined them
and I am happy I got a friend here, I can talk with him the way I like -
this rarely happes.\
\
When I took more than prescribed cources then Anil K email flooded the
students inbox that they should take their guide persmission before
taking up additional courses. I went to DKS to get approval signed and
tell him I want to study 'past Indian Scholarship' this semester that is
why I have taken this 'algorithm in astronomy' course. "*Woh to theek
hai par project main kami naa ho warna presentation wale din hum dono ki
thukai hogi.". "Sir, Main to chala jaunga is saal ke baad, aap apna dekh
lijiye."... "Lao idhar lao kaha sign karna hai."*After seeing this, Anil
K said, *" If your guide does not have any problem, I also dont
have.." *\
\
\
At the time of my final presentation, his last remark was, "*Tum bahut
bade item ho, ab ye forms to le aate. Do din ki chchutti hai. ye lo inhe
xerox karo, whitener use karke ye naam hata dena, fir xerox karna aur
aaj hi submit karo warna 15 din tak rukna padega. ye log ja rahe hai. Is
duniya main kabhi to kuch time to bitaya karo.."*Well, from '*tumhari
gand fat jayegi"*to this bashing I've learnt a lot from this man.\
\
Prof HN\
\
Prof Agashe was giving his introduction to one of his friend on third
floor of GG building , "*He is HN, he likes to switch-off the fan and
tube-lights.*" "*yes I am quite an expert in that."* HN'd said. I though
I should attend his lectures. I had the chance for taking '*Fundamental
of VLSI CAD'* instead of '*Hardware Description Language'.* But then I
took advice and still regret it. So in the next semester, I have taken
'*Advance Network Analysis".*\
\
Hardly 7-8 students were there in this course. Mostly his students! Only
I and Manoj Johnson were there from Microelectronics dept. Manoj
argument was simple, "*Grades are easy in this course."* Mine was stupid
so I did not tell anyone. During his first lecture he said, "*.....This
makes network analysis more stronger..."*Then he realised '*more
stronger'*does not make any sense. He stopped and laughed at himself.
Then I knew I did not have to think before I speak. So when he'd draw a
3-D geometry and ask us, "...*it is right?" *I replied, "*Yes, it is
making sense."*He'd chuckle. I never missed any of his lectures even if
they are in the morning. They were delight. Partly on his lectures,
partly the freedom he grant his students to think.\
\
During lectures, He'd tell us stories about 'William Tutte', "Sheshu and
Reed', 'Whitney', and about himself; then a disclaimer, "*Its not a show
off, but these are the only things you'd remember.. Marks, ranks,
prizes.. no one remembers.. Best is when you solve a problem or do
something which you appreciate."*Sometimes he'd ask one of us to be
'bold' and ask me to be '*right.. you are creative but you have to be
right..*"\
\
Sometimes when He'd not get any response from someone, he'd preach,
"*How'd you survive." *The he'd get thoughtful and close his eyes,
"*[Have you heard the story of boatman and a
Pundit.](http://www.ineval.org/sai/Teachings/SaiBabaGita/saigita199.html).
I know all of this but I dont know how to cross road.. everyday it is
narrow escape."* Sometimes He'd ask us to refer books of old writers and
tell about a Japanese Scholar who was very harsh on him when he used a
mathematical notation. Then he'd tell about his [unsolved problems of
'Hybrid
ranks'](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/113516054/abstract)
and declare that he does not have that material that good mathematician
have. Apparently he'd promised himself that He'd not do anything for two
month but solve it and he could not do it. Then he'd tell us about what
other mathematician told him, "*Yes it is a nice problem, solve it by
yourself."*\
\
He is a commited teacher, just like Prof. Vasi and Prof DKS. He also
worries that JEE is losing its discriminatory power because there are
lot of students who are not doing well despite of putting there best
effort. he meets student 12:30pm every working day to sort our their
personal problems. I also went to him few times. And He probably likes
drinking tea.\
\
When I went to him to get recommendation letter for PhD. position at
Institute of Mathematical Science, He said, "*No, I cant not give you
for mathematics. You are having this quality and problem of not able to
concentrate. See, you have gone through some kind of A,B,C,D kind of
examinations. They say somethig about you that you are good at
discarding wrong choices*.*What was your rank in GATE?" "1". "Dont think
you are great"..*All time I kept smiling but I liked his A,B,C,D analogy
of GATE exams. I also thought that way. In fact, after coming across few
M.Tech and B.Techs., I started to doubt whether there is any point in
these exams.\
\
Then he gave me an advice, "*Dont let people hit you else you will think
differently."* "*Oh, that is not going to happen."*I replied. *"Then
It's OK, I can give you back your recomendation letter."*I took my blank
reco and went to Prof DKS, and told him the story. He said, "*Now you
have a true picture of yourself how you'd do in mathematics.. Isliye
maine tumhe unke pass bheja tha. Woh aise nahi ghumate kisi ko, jo hai
woh bol dete hai.."*\
\
 He fondly remembers his B.Tech. and Ph.D. days specnd in IIT B library
when there was no AC and how he understood [Whitney
papers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassler_Whitney) about matroids
while sweating. Whitney  rose to prominence later, but HN was so happy
that he figuerd it out that this man is great. While saying it, his
right hand would mimic 'vande matram' kind of action.\
\
He was the first man to figure out that I have the habit of day-dreaming
and hoping that all the good things will happen. Then he'd ask to,
"*Stay like this."* Some time he'd say, "*I was not much different from
you, that is why i know what is going on in your mind."*\
\
There are lot of professors these days who do not get tired giving you
funde what to do for success (market?) - which in itself a nobel cause,
creating jobs in my land is need of time. This man argument about
publishing his result is simple, "*You need to survive in this world so
you publish your paper."***So here is a guy who don't care about all
these blah blah. I like him. Others will be remembered by those hands
who labour only for success.\
