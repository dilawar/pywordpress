\
I sincerely hope that you know whom I am talking about.  Well, It is
known as *Times of India* and it claims itself to be India's national
newspaper.\
 **  \
Even if I do not like it, I daily browse its horribly designed website.
They did not leave any stone unturned in making it non-readable. With
all the advertisements popping out here and there, it is like being
greeted with a prostitute when you visit a library to study. Honestly, I
do not go there to read anything. Yes, not even its '*ten places where
girls want to be touched'* garbage. I go there to look at its '[most
shared](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/mostshared.cms)' articles
every day. While 'most read' articles also say a lot about its readers
but the best way to interpret its readers, is by  most shared articles.
Sharing a article means that the chances of reading and liking a article
is much higher by the one who shared it, besides 'sharing' means that
his/her social circles is also influenced.\
\
The list is truly amazing. At any given day, week or month, sex related
articles are about 50-70%, followed by celebrities 10-30% and then some
other personal stuff. Rarely you see any articles of its editorial in
the most shared list. Exams related articles are to be found but they
are seasonal and mostly about some controversies.\
\
Since it is the highly read newspaper among the English speaking elites
of India, it can not be ignored. It also boasts its '*bazaru*'
(market-oriented) approach. The argument is like, "My readers want it."
Just like a drug paddler who'd say, "*Look I am nice guy, these assholes
on the streets want it, what can I do*?" If patriotism is the last
refuse of a scoundrel, then this argument is the last refuge of a utmost
morally corrupt, jug-head, bastard editors. Suddenly, Mark Twain start
making sense to me.\
\
Well, in case of this newspaper, there is hardly any editor. It is run
by managers who thinks that editors are disposable. A hell lot of
stenography is going on there. News? if they don't understand it, they
put it in science section. Editorials are simply to separate its
advertisement.\
\
Its not like that all is crap there (most of it is surely crap). It had
done a nice job speaking for rape victim (that is other story t[hat at
the same time revealing their identities in
public](http://www.thehoot.org/web/home/story.php?storyid=3796&mod=1&pg=1&sectionId=25&valid=true),
Why? Its pervert readers wants it?); and for the RTI and on Health issue
(most of them are sex related, but also when vaccine maker PSU was
closed down by heath minister). Once is while you see a common man on
its pages but mostly you see blond head, half-naked, fairer-than-Indian
on its pages and [sexuality oozes out of it from the very first
page](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/oct/10/times-india-sex).
\
\
Front page of a newspaper is like its body and the editorial is its
soul. It sells its body to anyone who can pay for it. It has not sold
its soul but downgraded it to the very extent. The plagiarism in this
newspaper is way too profound. It steals news reports from local
newspaper and publish it, Ok, there is some translation. Besides, it was
accused of paid news, remember *know you candidate* drama during
elections.\
\
Well, may be to a person who loves being successful at any cost; it may
make sense to go TOI ways. Whenever the Times has emerged from its lair
in Mumbai and stomped into a new city, its competitors wet their pants.
The paper is known for its fiery marketing strategies, and has an
uncanny knack of bulldozing its way to the top. "*Soft porn journalism*"
is a weapon it has employed with stunning impact in this marketing war –
primarily targeting young people, especially university students, who
are discovering their sexuality.\
\
Even if we consider, may be it want to [educate people about
sex](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jun/06/india-sexpert-sex-education)with
its
[sexpert](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2004/jul/30/health.publichealth)s.
Consider what they know about sex. The writer who writes about sex have
at most I.Q. of 10 year old. The data is possibly collected from
Facebook links.\
\
This paper was not started with the novel intentions. It has
been vision-less at the time of its birth and remained blind. Writing in
Outlook, [Khushwant Singh had something to say about this
newspaper](http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?220785),\

May be you'd love to look at this newspaper while rubbing your penis but
would you like to see your children growing up seeing this newspaper
every morning. There is hardly any values left in this paper. And the
way it depicts women? Well...\
\
TOI capitalize on sex as well as low trust among boys and girls. Sex is
very much '*me and myself*' feeling. There are other such tendencies
among Indians. '*Me and myself*' has seen a widespread reach following
the globalisation.\
\
E. P. Thompson once said that, "*There is not a though which is ever
thought in west is not active in some Indian mind.*" But it is
impossible to get any of those ideas in this newspaper. I really do not
have high opinion about its readers. Most of them are just
reactionaries. Their comments on its stories says it all. Hardly any new
information is added. Every Tom, Dick and Harry is out there to make a
comment and share it on the Facebook. Besides, there is not journalist
to be found working for this paper. All are stenographers!!\
\
Everything aside, I just can not stand a newspaper which boasts itself
for not having a single book-review page despite of having 50+ pages of
crap. But how daring? At the same time it has wonderful plan to teach
India.\

[1] [There's no such thing as society," British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher once declared. "There are individual men and women and there
are families."](http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/L-nosociety.htm) Indian,
generally considered a '[survival
society](http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl2704/stories/20100226270400400.htm)'
worrying about themselves and their families at best. Few authoritative
indologist has gone far to declare Indians as '[Homo Hierarchicus'(See
Appendix A).](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Hierarchicus) These days
we are seeing a more acute emphasis on values in economics - strangely
the field of economics which has been [notorious in escaping social
values](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/oct/08/economics-nobel-women-bailout-stockmarket) has
awarded Nobel prize to Sociologists. [Partha
Dasgupta](http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780192853455.do)- perhaps
the next mother Teresa of economics after Amartya Sen - has done a nice
job relating 'Trust' with economics development. His argument that where
there is more trust, economy flourish seems all right in India. Northern
states where 'trust' is lesser than their 'southern counterparts' are
more '[BIMARU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIMARU)'. I do not have the
data to back this argument, just experience. In Delhi it hard to get
'lift' than in 'Chennai', in fact people stop there if you look at them.
