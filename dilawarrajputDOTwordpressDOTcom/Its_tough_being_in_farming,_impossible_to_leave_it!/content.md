In order to get your attention, let me boast a little bit. I was one of
the 100 percentile in GATE-2007. So I was able to convince my family to
let me spend more time in an university - not like the one I had been
at. Only we know, how my family paid my tuition fees during my U.G..
They wanted me to do a job after completing my U.G. so that I could pay
back the loan they have taken from local moneylender for my studies. The
interest rate was 30% and its been four years. I am not saying that we
are poor farmers - at least by Indian farmers standard which is very
simple;[If you are alive, you are not
poor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_India). We belong to less
than one percent of farmers whose annual income is about 50k. And since
in my village, there is plenty of ground water for irrigation, you can
be sure that next year you can can make that much of profit - if
sugar-mill will pay your money on time which hardly happens. For one
child, we had enough. But I was not the only one in college. My elder
brother was just out of the college and got the job - a relief. Younger
just entered into one. So his his expenses was covered by his salary.
For four years all of our income went into paying the interest only.\
\
If you are from a less-privileged places, it is always dangerous to tell
others your *success story*. They will hang others with you. They will
make a hero out of you and send message to others, "*Look! If he can why
you can't?*" and will pass all the responsibility on them. It's really
horrible. The odd of you winning a crore rupee lottery is higher than
finding a *success story* from a village. Its a win win situation for
them. On one hand they make us feel that we should never ask them for
providing opportunities (at least), on the other hand they easily escape
the criticism also. Look, system is working over there! Otherwise this
would have never been possible. It is perhaps a common Indian attitude,
if you are successful, everyone wants to prove his part in your success;
if you are a failure, they have nothing to do with you. You are on your
own. Its just not government, you can find it at every level of Indian
society including family.\
\
I hardly tell anyone any of it, there is hardly a chance one will
understand what one has never felt. It applies for everyone. Neither I
will understand what you have been through. Still stories must be told.
Words are powerful if not omnipotent. Whenever I tell this to anyone
from cities. All of them find a fault with us. Why didn't you approach a
bank? You could have got loan easily. There are plenty of advertisement
saying so. Like ads are for real! Honestly we did. My father is not a
big fan of Banks since he had paid 24% interest loan for tractor with
all of his land as collateral - not a much difference and you can get
loan from money-lender very easily without paper work. Thanks to the
green-card which was introduced in 2005 which gives us credit worth 1.5
lacs at the interest rate of 9%. This is only good thing we ever get
from the government. When I was planning to get admission for M. Tech.,
I approached State Bank of India, waited there for two hours to be told
that I have to go to Moradabad, 60 Km away, to get the forms. It was not
only me, there was one family over there they told me they have to spend
7 days to get the forms only. I had 15 days to pay the fees. Then I went
to Canara Bank, they simply refused since they were not issuing new
loans. Apparently they were having trouble recovering old loans. Bank of
Baroda was sympathetic. They politely said they since your village is
more than 4 km away from them, they will not grant the loans. Why don't
you go to a bank in the radius of 4 km. So we came out of bank, my
younger brother was furious. He wished if he had a gun. I asked him to
gain his composure and we approached '*Bidur Gramin Bank*' which is 2 km
away from my village. All of the village banking is done over here.\
\
Manager was happy to know that someone from a farmer family is going to
IIT. Then he said, we do not have any policy regarding education loan.
You want to buy buffalos, tractor, fertilizers, pesticides, we can give
loan. But there is not policy regarding education loan. I could have
lost my mind there, had I been not blessed with a weired sense of humor.
I came home, told my father that what your educated son was able to
accomplish today. **They say that there is no policy of education loan
for farmers.**\
\
Two days later, we got a loan for buffaloes and we showed some one else
buffaloes as ours. Yes! What a corrupt people we are. Out of disgust I
wrote an email to RBI, and this reply came back,\

Then these managers lost their minds. Apparently, there was a letter for
every branch manager in the area and they were running around in my
village to get the application signed by my father. He signed it despite
of my younger brother resistance. Why make them suffer? They are
beautiful people!\
\
This was the first lesson in rural sociology for me. People were happy.
I still have not got the loan, neither I needed it anymore. They could
have paid my fees anyway by collecting money from here and there.
Anyway, scholarship was enough to pay the fees. For some, if TA-ship is
their lifeline, for some its money to booze out. It is the sense of the
power which made these villagers happy. They were listen to. That is
why, they go out there to vote for a person they do not know or probably
will never know. And I am so happy that you guys do not vote. Please do
not go out there to vote no matter what your media tells you. Else we
really have to commit suicide in really large number to get ourselves
heard as farmers in Maharashtra are doing even though agriculture
minister is from their state. That does not boil the blood of any
*Marathi Manoos*. Perhaps this is very Indian thing to live like a dog.
Few of us, generally go out and protest sometime to be beaten up by the
police till we crap out. Peace, is what you love because it is
beneficial to you. Disorder is what we need. Since there is not other
channel left for us to get our voices heard. The privatization of media
has effectively blocked whatever was left.\
\
True, we do vote for criminals (thats what you call them, though we
don't see any difference - you are better at hiding it) even though we
know well in advance that most of them are not going to do anything. But
the assurance is there that you can come to their places and talk with
them. **Besides if voting for someone who does work is the main reason
for which rural folks votes, you still be having the British
Government**. We'll vote for anyone who can promise us '*a survival with
dignity*'. [Besides they are much less corrupt than most (any) of
you](http://beta.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/article399250.ece?homepage=true).\
\
The revolution that ensued after 1857, all of those who cared about this
nation ruined themselves financially. Whoever left rich at that time was
the opportunist section of Indian who shamelessly aligned with British
for their own benefits as Aurobindo Ghosh anticipated in his 1893 essay
(“*A Cheap Shoddy Import*”) and D.D. Kosambi recalled, some 50 years on,
in his review of Jawaharlal Nehru's *Discovery of India*. One of the
earliest tributes paid to the Indian middle class is to be found in the
1961 essay by B.B. Misra, where he called it “**[a product of British
benevolence](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3020512).**” Today, most of
this upper middle class, as it exists, are their children. How many of
them talk about nation at the dinner table? How many of them knows what
is ailing their motherland? How many of them dream of living for a cause
if there is no media coverage? At most they can join a Facebook
community to show that they really care. They love doing what there
forefather had done. Aligned with the powerful and lick their arse. No
wonder, most of them just love America - forgetting what it wanted to do
with India when she was just born. It's just not U.S. or Europe, for
last 5 years, the biggest haters of China (Indian Express and co) has
suddenly become the biggest lover of it. Every time they have to make a
point about economy, they invoke China first. China have defeated us
second time - this time it breaks our backbone. Pakistan suffered that
too, he always define India first then he declares, "**I am what India
is not."***.*Thats the tragedy with him. If you've got money and power,
don't forget to make Indians your bitches.\

\
A section of this class, mostly from the traditional families were left
untouched, are in Tamilnadu, West Bengal, Mysore (Bangalore)  and
Kerala. On the other extreme, Delhi and and a part Mumbai are notorious
for its ever-greedy businessmen, pig-head editors and and ultra-corrupt
government officials. In Bangalore and Chennai, you can easily find mini
Bill Gates. Traditions societies have their own values and they should
not be discarded as rapidly they are being in North India.\
\
Let me be grumpier and rant a bit more. Getting loan is a part of a
farmer life. Since the time of *Premchand's*"Godan" to
*Sainath's*"Everyone loves a good drought", hardly [anything have
changed](http://www.indiatogether.org/2010/feb/psa-suicides.htm) for
good. Well, this is something else. **What troubles me what you do in
our name**.\
\
Every budget speech claims that this budget is farmer friendly. Look at
these speeches\
\

> *The real heroes of India's success story were our farmers. Through
> their hard work, they ensured "food security" for the country.* -
> Pranab Mukherjee, interim budget speech Feb. 16, 2009 \
> **

> *This Budget belongs to 'Aam Aadmi'. It belongs to the farmer, the
> agriculturist, the entrepreneur and the investor.* - Pranab Mukherjee,
> budget speech, Feb. 26, 2010

Gee! \

[![](http://dilawarrajput.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/book1.jpg?w=200)](http://dilawarrajput.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/book1.jpg)

\
Let me quote Sainath - possibly the only man with balls alive today,
"*Editorials across ten years have always found "a new thrust" to
agriculture that spelt "good news" for the farmer. Rarely mentioned are
the massive subsidies, now larger than ever before, for the Corporate
sector. This year alone, the budget gifts over Rs.500,000 crores in
write-offs, direct and indirect, to the Big Boys. That's Rs.57 crores
every single hour on average - almost a crore a minute. Beating last
year's Rs.30 crores an hour by more than 70 per cent. (See Tables 5 and
12 of the "Statement of Revenue Foregone*" *section of the budget*.). \
\
May be pro-farmer was a typo. Yes, it must have been a typo. The English
speaking media can not be that dumb to notice the difference. Let's sail
through the budget. While most of the t.v. channels were busy arguing,
Will FM behave "like a CEO of Indian Inc." or will he behave like a
"politician".  *A second ad in this series read: "Will FM's speech
DESTROY or CREATE Market Wealth?"* What they mean by wealth is the
notional money which will come back after 2 days anyway if destroyed
today.*In the event, the Finance Minister more than lived up to their
demands. The budget hands out new bonanzas for Corporate Kleptocrats.*It
goes further than earlier ones in pushing the private sector as prime
driver of development and economy. Not the public sector.   \
\
I still have not find any thing pro-farmer inside. Lets look deeper. May
be somewhere there is something inside for *Dilawar's father et al*.\

\
Ok, some more . They are trying to expand their Forbes list, that O.K.
*Jai Ho!* They can not be that much cold towards us. It took over a
1,50,000 suicide to bring out a movie in our name. Moving further,\
\

A farmer taking loan of 10 crore? Have you seen any of them. I havn't.
All I wanted was 16000 to pay my semester fees.\

\
There goes our buffalo loans also. There is no hope left should one more
Dilawar tops a national competitions.\

Says Sainath, "*Remember the excuse trotted out for letting Big Retail
sell agricultural produce? It would do away with the "middleman," giving
farmers and consumers a better deal. Yet prices of fresh produce are
costlier at big retail's outlets. You still get a better deal from the
petty vendor on the street. Often, that pathetic "middleman" they're
crushing is a poor woman street vendor. The last and weakest link in the
chain of intermediaries between farmer and public. The new middlemen
wear suits.* "\

\
Ok, these LSE educated pig-head economists. *Never mind that some of
these deluded dissenters warned - correctly - of the type of crisis that
shook the world in 2008. Not one of the "experts" ever came within miles
of predicting that meltdown. They were in fact proclaiming the Golden
Age to be upon us when their babble hit the fan. But no questions on
their competence. Many of the "experts" have direct ties to large
corporations and peddle their interests with zest. Sometimes, with a
little more sophistication than panting media hucksters who show not a
trace of the scepticism their profession demands of them. Straining at
the leash to beat their rivals in serving the richest 1 per cent (or
less) of Indians.*\
\
Hmm.. Should I kill some of those who are responsible of this or should
we keep killing ourselves to get ourselves heard. Look, [Subcomandante
Marcos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcomandante_Marcos)! Can you come
here for some time? Look George Orwell, It's 1984!\
\
\
They, Indian government on one hand and subsidy by US and Europe to
their farmers on the other hand, have made our life miserable in
farming. The only voice we have is ballot box. We did it once in 2005
when we changed the government we did not want which shook the pundit of
media very heavily. Asks BJP they will tell you. UPA survived because of
NREGA. Like '[Left in
Bengal](http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2007/mitra201107.html)' they are
also taking us for granted. May be it time to teach them a lesson too.
We also want a stable government but not at every cost or for your
benefits. Why should we go hungry just because your ass and your belly
starts competing with each other to get fatter day by day.\
\
 \
 Over last 3 years I have lost almost all of the faith in this perverse
middle class. I have grown sympathetic to Naxals even though I find
their actions wrong headed. Democracy in India is very much alive and
very strong since only poor people votes and they are the only one who
should. Time by time, they try to take away this from us. Sometimes in
the name of larger weight-age for their votes. Funny! Like  this gonna
happen. They are[much more
narcissist](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/article834612.ece) than
Mayawati could only dream of.  \
\
\
Sometimes they like to listen to us, not to what we say but to a middle
class guy who suppose to be a social entrepreneur. The reporter comes to
the village, interview this guy and goes away. If you are in village,
talk to the villager. Why they choose to ignore the real people? Due to
their consumers - who are middle class. Now this has got to be published
as an ideal middle class life. Look! He is from middle class and doing
all this service to a village. You must aspire to do so. Its like the
movie, *Swadesh*where villages are used to lift the image of the hero.
Just to please the middle class how great they can be and look, there is
ultra fair looking girl talking in an accent as alien as her look - who
can travel to  Delhi to buy thousands rupees of books, yet the Hero can
not go there without using his own vehicle. Have you notices a single
bus on the roads? How did she travel? - . And of course, you can dream
of romance and marriage.Villages are not as pretty as they have shown.
Still something is better than nothing. 'Welcome to Sajjanpur', I can
say represent a big village of Uttar Pradeh.\

Talking of Education, there have been a huge improvement in
infrastructure in primary schools. But one benefit is negated by other.
They have lowered the quality of teachers. They call them *siksha
mitra*. They are just 12th passed and got paid 4000 pm - much higher
than what they pay in a private schools as low as 1500 pm. One of my
colleague in office did not believe me unless other told him and I am
right. Her cousin works in the suburban of Delhi who get only 900 pm
teaching nursery kids. You can see [this wonderful
work](http://www.globalresourcesalliance.org/cms/82.html).\
\
\
After ruining economy, now these bastards, popularly know as whiz kids
has [turned their eyes on
agriculture](http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2010/oct/15/world-food-day-financial-regulation)
and micro credit. Micro-credit by Muhammad Yunus, who gave this hope for
the revival of the rural economy is now under threat from these.
Unfortunately IIT Bombay have the history producing few of these
bastards. [Microlending has grown so popular that some of its biggest
proponents are now wringing their hands over the direction the industry
has
taken.](http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2010/04/14/world/20100414-MICROFINANCE_index.html) This
year we have seen over 1 billion people going bed hungry. A bank Shell
have already made \$2 billion out of people misery. I dont how much
other have exploited. [Speculation over the grain have already made the
food costlier for
poor](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/oct/19/commodities). When
prices were rising, all sorts of explanations were proffered: rising
food demand from China and India, the impact of rising oil prices on the
costs involved in producing and transporting food, the role played by
subsidised production of biofuels that moved acreage and grain
production away from food crops. Of these factors, the first was
completely wrong – food grain demand in both *China and India* has
actually fallen in recent times, contrary to what George W. Bush and
Wall Street Journal were shouting – but there was something in the rest.
Yet they could not explain the full extent of the dramatic food price
volatility.\
\
The [World Development
Movement](http://www.wdm.org.uk/food-speculation "World Development Movement")
(WDM) has issued a damning report on July 19, 2010 on the growing role
of [hedge
funds](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/hedge-funds "More from guardian.co.uk on Hedge funds")
and banks in the
[commodities](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/commodities "More from guardian.co.uk on Commodities")
markets in recent years, during which time cocoa prices have more than
doubled, energy prices have soared and coffee has fluctuated
dramatically. Financial speculators have come under renewed fire from
anti-[poverty](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/poverty "More from guardian.co.uk on Poverty")
campaigners for their [bets on food prices, blamed for raising the costs
of goods such as coffee and
chocolate](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/jul/06/commodities-cocoa-futures-liffe)
and threatening the livelihoods of farmers in developing countries.\

Courtsey : TheHindu

\

Now back in India, out Agricultural minister, who spent all of time
promoting cricket and hence is the Hero of Cricket consuming media,
blamed us and poor monsoon for all of this. One of them is busy making a
pro-farmer budget and other is happy blaming us for not doing the
farming properly. There was only one bad monsoon after an spree of 10
good monsoon. Consider what could have happened of we had 2-3 bad
monsoons? Indians are fucking ignorant. I don't know why? As Jefferson
has said, "**If ignorance is bliss, why aren't more people happy?**" If
we say something, they claim that we do not understand, it will take
some time to *trickle down*. History tell us, noting ever tricked down
from the pocket of  an Indian in general and North Indians in
particular.\
\
Well, its not in our nature to cry over. We have this sort of attitude
for life, "*Bring it on Bitch.".*But lately I have spend so many years
with middle class people, I have also bitten by this bug. These people
are spineless. A little bit of trouble, and look them cry. Pussies!
Having a voice is the first requirement to break away from poverty -
anyone from U.N. will tell you. This voice is exactly what they deny us.
How many newspaper have a full time correspondent working on poverty?
How many farmers you see on the pages of your newspaper?\
\
I get this all the time. What you are doing for your village rather than
talking? Honestly, first of all, [hardly any problem we face is created
by
us](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/article634136.ece).
I just keep telling others not to create trouble for us, we do not have
resources to solve them. Sometimes, they just call me some -ist, -ian
and go back to their usual arguments. Most of the time, I get the
sympathy which is worst and goes against my dignity, both as a farmer
and as traditional rajput culture - though these days there is hardly
any difference left. Sympathy is the last thing we need. It's our right
to get the fair price of our product. It's due to our right not because
any of you feel sorry.\
\
You probably will never know, lemme tell you, the minimum support price
(MSP) which government establishes for farmers does not contain any
profit. Profit is 0%. If you are farmer, you are not entitled for
profit. And I worked in an office which had this paper on the entrance
door quoting some Nobel prize winner economist, "**Be ruthless for
profit. Profit is the best what one can offer to society. ... "**Now can
I ask, if profit for the riches is so sacred, why we are denied this
profit in MSP?\
\
Over the last 20 years, I have seen a tremendous change in the attitude
of farmers. They no longer introduce themselves proudly as my
grandfather used to do. He did not let my father do a job in bank. He
thought it is a form of slavery. The effect of neo-liberal media is so
profound on them that they have started introducing themselves
apologetically. Once you loose your self esteem, you are as good as
dead. Media keeps telling us that we are looser. We dont have a car, our
children can not speak English, our women wears so many clothes. No
wonder they are committing suicide. Being poor can not be the only
reason, they have been poor all along. Villagers have astonishing will
to survive with dignity. Its the dignity they took from us. None of them
wants to be in farming anymore even if other options are not pretty!\
\
My be its time we also learn to bite since public offices are being 
made for private convenience. Besides, Its the utmost duty of a citizen
to be a pain in the ass of his government.\
\
END NOTES :\
\
[1] Here is one story of successful farmer but alas, no every Village
have resources to go to Israel to learn things .This indeed a rare
example and must not be taken as an alternative. Besides if U.S. stopped
giving subsidies, their farming will collapse in a month. This type of
model are being forced on us.
