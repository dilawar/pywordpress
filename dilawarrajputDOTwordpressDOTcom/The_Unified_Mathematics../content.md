International Congress of Mathematics was held at Hyderabad in India
this year. Unfortunately, these kinds of events generally lost in the
glamor of awards and laudations of few individuals. Mathematicians are
weired creatures, at least when it comes to awards. They try their best
to keep the novice out of their domain. Engineers are diagonally
opposite. Despite of all the claims that their awards are targeted on
young people so they can be brought in to research, their rewards do not
motivate anyone who gets it. How many awards they give anyway. Two are
the most prominent of them which are given by Mathematicians to
Mathematicians are

and Nevanlinna Awards. Once in every four years! How many they did
motivate in a decade? 2 and a half men! Kid (below 40 years of age) who
have got it is already super-motivated and hardly  need any support.
Already all door are open to him - already a professor in some
university!. Funny people.\

Well, for journalism and literature etc these awards do matter. They
make their recipients hugely popular and lot of people start consuming
their works. But in the case of Mathematics, this is also not the case.
There is no chance I can read and understand their works. But wait, this
year was slightly different. They awarded Nevanlinna prize to [Daniel
Spielman](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/).. Now his work is
written so well that even you and me can read it.  **First time in the
history of Mathematics, seems like readability matters.**\
\
The other Mathematician whom I can read is [Terrence
Tao](http://terrytao.wordpress.com/). His blogs are very informative and
his books are just awesome. Though, I also romanticize Manjul Bhargava,
but you know, these Princeton guys find a lot of pleasure in making
their work unreadable for lesser mortals.\
\
Now since the time of G. H. Hardy's *A Mathematician Apology*, a lot of
things have changed for good in this world of Mathematics.  The
boundaries are fast disappearing between *pure*and *applied*
mathematics. Look at the work profile of all[seven prize
winners](http://www.icm2010.in/prize-winners-2010). Even historically,
these boundaries drawn out between pure and applied mathematics were ill
conceived (Sorry, Hardy!). People who were trying to solve everyday
problems came up with theories which later laid the foundation of *pure
mathematics*. Problem of *Heat Conduction* gave birth to Fourier Series.
Euclid and Archimedes were fascinated with their own everyday problems.
Even the innocent looking axioms did not reveal themselves. They were
found while finding a solution to some problem. I am happy that these
boundaries are disappearing. But there will always be a need to protect
Mathematics from utilitarian school of thoughts. * *\
\
*The Hindu* newspaper, with a history of understanding science, had this
to say about this year ICM, * *\

> *Indeed, some very important talks in the Hyderabad Congress are in
> areas of pure mathematics inspired by problems in applied mathematics.
> It is this wonderful duality of mathematics — the joy of pursuit of
> pure mathematics for its intrinsic aesthetic experience, and its
> increasing relevance to real-life problems — that must be projected in
> greater measure to school and college students.*

INDIA RISING AGAIN?\
\
There was bit euphoria in Indian Mathematical circles since it was the
first time ICM was held in India, possible to acknowledge that current
Indian contribution to the world of Mathematics is reasonable good and
increasing. Possibly that is why they also they named one of their award
after
[Leelavati](http://www.hindu.com/2010/06/09/stories/2010060961982200.htm).\
\
Now Indian contribution to Number Theory is perhaps well known. A lot of
Indian Mathematicians, except Ramanujan, were spoilt by Hardy to work on
his life long fascination of series and convergence  - as Andrew Weil (
Professor at Aligarh Muslim University, of Barbauki fame) once said.
[Beyond
Ramanujan](http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl2719/stories/20100924271911400.htm),
we had K. Ananda Rau, S.S. Pillai, S. Chawla, T. Vijayaraghvan, K.
Chandrashekhran, S.  Minakshisundram. \
\
A very prominent Indian Mathematician [*M. S.
Raghunathan*](http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1726/17261130.htm),
wrote in 2007, "*Our nurture of the potential has been less than
satisfactory. But there is room for cautious optimism about the
future."* After three years in 2010, he made a claim that, *"While the
numbers in India are small and on the average Indian mathematicians may
not have a good standing, the peaks are world class.”*Now the media,
which are bitten by the super-power syndrome did not hesitate to
headline it, [**"India a world mathematics power, says Professor
Raghunathan."**](http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/article347210.ece)\

On some positive side, my Institute IIT Bombay and TIFR Mumbai are
comping up National Center of Mathematics at IITB campus. And just a
note, the committee which awarded Spielman award was headed by ex-EE IIT
Bombay, Ravi Kannan.\
