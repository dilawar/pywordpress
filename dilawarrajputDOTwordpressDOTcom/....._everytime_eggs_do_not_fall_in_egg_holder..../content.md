Uff!! it is the reaction when i read a article in a national newspaper
about rape and murder of british teenager Scarlette keeling on Anjuna
beach in Goa. A slight amusement came out when I surf the british
newspaper website to get the idea or their coverage of the issue..\
\
They say we need more women in sensitive position to empower women. no
doubt about it in general, they have been living in a male dominated
society in which over the time they are being taken for granted. India
has a pathetic record when it comes to gender inequalities or children
malnutrition.. well, this is not about all this.. this particular
episode have some travesty of this popular belief.\
\
media is one of the sensitive place where there is significant numbers
of women in sensitive position. From tv anchor to top notch journalist.
The particular handling of this episode (tragedy) shows that merely
having women journalist in place does not guarantees that gender
politics will also fall in place. What seemed to be at work was the
pretence of a populist concession to public concerns...\
\
Someone is raped and murder, thats in general a very sensitive issue at
least for those who cares about the world around them otherwise it just
80 year long life,, and philosophies like "I want to break free" and "
live it to full extent" are taken in very wrong way. Every report on tv
starts with the pictures of the bruised body of the victim so that the
audience can be kept glued to their seats.. On talk shows and in media,
some stupid questioned her mother sexual behaviour. We Indian love to
find fault in everything, thats the gift we have, afterall we have a
society which vastly differs, differences are obvious and we have
criticla eyes! Ok back to the point.. Producers may argue, As to
increase TRP on which familiar hook on which to peg the story? half of
the story tells us to think about the image of the Goa which is already
infused with dissent intertwined with the corrupt image of Politicians
regarding SEZ and sexual behaviour of tourists. Where was the
sensitivity to the gender issues in the whole damn coverage? Its not a
issue to be discussed in tabloids between the pages depicting girls in
bikini.. Somewhre, in parallel to someone's death and rape .. death and
rape of the Goa were used.. Do we have any sensitivity for anyone who is
got into the problematic situation but refused to play victim, well
thats not the case in particular here!\
\
There were negative sensitivity though, highlighting her tatoos and her
alternative lifestyle contributing her daughter death, producing details
about her past sexual life. Media is becoming drama, Education is now
training, rape and murder are being started justified indirectly,
prostitution is not a problem now for some though the implications seems
to be so serious for the society as a whole..\
\
In the mean time .. Honourable State minister of maharashtra, pointing
to the farmers suicide in the state, said that committing suicide is a
crime, they should be grateful that I am not filing a case against them.
While Chief Justice of India yesterday said- "Chief Justice of India is
not a public servant but a constitutional authority.".. What made them
think so is not clear, pressure of work or just an innocent
observation...\
\
things are not going well around us!
