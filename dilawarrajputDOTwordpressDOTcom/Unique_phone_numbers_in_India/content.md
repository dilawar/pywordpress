When I posted mine and other teaching assistant's mobile numbers on IITB
Moodle and mentioned that my number has two prime factor, in case you
wants to verify; and others should be right since I copy and pasted
them, Srihari  replied back,\

> Sunny got 3 prime factors and you 2 as you said..while achin had 6..\

Well, unfortunately these kind of emails are considered spam in Indian
Universities. But anyway, here is what I am able to reply,\

Achin number is then probably worth envy. One can do the simulation. But
theorem proving will be good. The maximal is 2x3x5x7x11x13x19x23x29 =
6469693230. It has ten distinct prime factors. But it does not start
with 9. And another multiplication will make it 11 digit. If we drop one
of the prime in this list, we can check whether there exists another
prime which can be used as replacement. In fact, 41 is a prime which can
do that. Drop 29, and multiply by 41 we'll get **9146807670**and
**9592993410**with 43. What about other numbers with 10 prime factors?
If we drop two primes e.g. 23 and 29, then product of rest becomes
9699690. Then we need two distinct prime such that their product is
somewhere between 928 and 1030 (else the total product will not have 9
as its first digit). There aren't any! **SO THERE ARE ONLY TWO NUMBERS
WITH TEN PRIME FACTORS**. I called them up. First one is in Maharashtra
(it was switched off) and second one is in Haryana (He did not know what
the hell is a prime number so he gave the phone to his brother, he also
did not know and I did not explain.)\
\
One can find many numbers with 9 prime factors by dropping 23 and
multiplying by others (this makes 223092870 one of the mothers of all
such numbers). This mother have, in addition to the above two, following
children,\
\
9369900540\
9592993410\
9816086280\
\
One sure can take clues from it. I have dropped 29 and multiplied with
other numbers (41, 42, etc). You can drop others and figure out. They
should not be more than 4 children for each mother (proof?). I can
establish upper bound by 36 (surely less than that). Now since the
problem is yours, you deserve the joy of solving it fully. This was a
nice one by the
way!! ![smile](http://moodle.iitb.ac.in/pix/s/smiley.gif)

\
So there could be at max 36 such numbers (with at least 9 prime factors,
and they are surely less than 36). I wonder who are the lucky
bastards possessing them?\
