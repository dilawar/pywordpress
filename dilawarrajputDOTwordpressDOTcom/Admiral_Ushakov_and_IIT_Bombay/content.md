Russian President Dimitry Medvedev visited IIT Bombay on Dec 22, 2010
(Thanks to Mr. Anonymous for correcting the date). Russian contribution
in establishing IIT Bombay was tremendous. You can measure their
contribution by noting that on our website '[history of IIT
Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/about/how.html)' page acknowledges it in
six lines out of total ten lines written about IIT-B history. 60% by
line numbers and since these 6 lines are longer, their contribution
become larger if one take 'words' written about it as a unit. \

In January 15, 1959, a ship named after one of the most deadliest
battle-cruiser of her time "Admiral Ushakov" arrived in Bombay with
first consignment of instruments for IIT Bombay. Now this deadly
"Admiral Ushakov" is a central theme on at least one novel and appeared
in many books (use google books). However, our peaceful ship which came
to India with same name, otherwise forgotten, appeared only once in a
news report in a Madras based newspaper 'The Hindu' two days later after
its arrival, January 17, 1959. This report points out that this
consignment was a part of a larger deal 'between Nehru's government and
USSR' to supply 'a total equipment worth three million rubels' . 'The
equipment' said this report 'comprises mostly electronic engineering
apparatus' for 'laboratories for physics, electrical engineering, radio
and television instruments on geodesy'.[1]\

It is remarkable that this incident was not reported in Bombay based
media especially by "EconomicÂ ~~times~~ Weekly" (now known as Economic
and Political Weekly). Alas a newspaper like 'Bombay Chronicle' was dead
by now. Possibly they did not find it worthwhile and except Bhabha and
Nehru failed to see that these institutes could become envy of the world
one day to be visited by Presidents and Prime Ministers.\
