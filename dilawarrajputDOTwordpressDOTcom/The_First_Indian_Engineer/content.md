How should I justify title of this blog when every Indian is a born
engineers. Go to any Village, you'll see them inventing ingenious
solutions to their problems all the time. This discipline, known as
*jugaad* (makeshift) is a way too Indian. Finding first engineer among
them, even if we consider only recorded history, would be way too hard.
Thats when we are not considering history as told in Ramanyan which runs
in eons.  Here, we are concerned with innovators with a knowledge of
modern theories. I am not claiming that even among them there was no one
before him who was not worthy of this title. Possibly some other person 
from first Indian engineering college i.e.  College of Engineering
Guindy or from the second one i.e. Roorkee College (now IIT Roorkee)
could have been well qualified. But history is blind beyond the
available knowledge of the gone days. Till some historian dig up
something about others, I have to contend myself with this option.\
\
In most of the countries, tough and tumultuous times are known to
produce great thinker, sane activists, remarkable leaders and wonderful
writers. In peaceful times, we see scientists and scholars flourishing.
India, being an unnatural nation, defies that logic also. When we saw
Gandhi, Nehru, Ambedkar, Lohia, Patel etc, we also had Ramanujan, Bose,
Raman at the same time. It seems like that in India, most of the great
things happen simultaneously. We also have witnessed all the revolutions
starting at the same time, the birth of India (national revolution),
democracy and social revolution, urbanization and industrialization.
Juxtapose it with U.S., '*which proclaimed its national independence in
18th century, urbanized and industrialized in 19th century, and became
democratic only in 20th century*'[1].\
\
Ok, question! This Indian engineer, though working mainly in the USA,
won 40 patents in printing technology. He made so many other inventions
in different fields that American technologists often referred to him as
‘Indian Edison’? Our man here, Shankar Abaji Bhisey. He himself
cherished Edison and considered him his role model. Still I love to see
him as more of an Engineer than an Edison. Though his inventions were
important and numerous but not as of Edison. Neither his life was as
impressive as of Edison. But no doubt, he was altogether a different
breed of Indian - the bold one. When he wanted to enroll in the college
of Science in Poona, his father disapproved. He decided to finance his
own scientific ventures and sought a job in Accounts General office's at
Bombay from 1888 to 1897 [2]. \
\
His life becomes more remarkable since those days, neither we had the
tradition of producing engineers nor we had the history of them.
Philosophers, thinkers, writers, artists were abundant in his time. A
tribe of scientists was increasing, both in their influence and numbers.
Yet, he chose building up stuff and influenced next generation of
Maharashtrian scientists, most notably V R Kokatnur. ibid.\
\
\
He is mostly known for his invention in [printing
technology](http://www.prideofindia.net/sc1.html), Bhiso-type, a
typecaster referred to as spacotype by some western journal. Abhidha
Dumatkar, a historian at Sathya College has done a remarkable job in
cataloging his life and innovations, [published in
EPW](http://beta.epw.in/newsItem/comment/188891/). It is the first time
perhaps that anything about him so concrete came out in English. His
invention were numerous and diverse. Consider the list - automatic
weighing, delivering and registering machine for railways, automatic
bicycle stand and lock, Vertolite sign lamp, a washing compound named
Shella, Baseline - a drug which cure malaria, auto toilet flusher
(Thankfully no one sponsered it which could have caused water shortage
problems). He was also much interested in mind-reading, mediation,
astrology and palmistry. It is claimed in [2] that he has predicted the
rise of Mahatma Gandhi and Indian liberation out of his dream. He also
wrote some plays and drama.\
\
His life also sheds light on the development of science and technology
in Mumbai. Possibly, he and Tatas were India's first ever syndicate
between an Engineer and a corporate house in India. *Tata Bhisey
Invention Syndicate* at London became a proud and significant Indian
achievement which employed many Europeans. After cracks started
appearing between Tata's and Bhisey, he moved to U.S. permanently and
got rid of Mechanical inventions which used to cost him a lot of money,
he turned to pharmacology.\
\
Dadabhai Naoriji, who was also the first significant patron of cricket
in Bombay, helped and nourished Bhise in his early days. Its a pity that
Naoriji could not find a place in Guha's *'Makers of Modern India'.* His
early research ventures were financed by Naoriji. He also offered Bhise
some monthly allowance. Nothing much is known about their relationships.
If some of it exists, it should be in some Marathi newspapers of olden
days. May be some Marathi Historian will like to shed some light on this
in English as Dumatkar did in [2]. \
\
Now Bombay, started quite nicely in the field of Science, is not at the
center of technology and science. Its place, justifiably, has been taken
by Bangalore. Even Chennai seems to outperform it. Only TIFR, TISS and
IIT Bombay are the Institutes left with some caliber due to their
isolation from outside influence. From the establishment of VJTI by
Naoriji, Pherozeshah Mehta, M G Ranade and K T Telag, and the growth of
TIFR led by Tatas, [Mumbai
University](http://frontline.in/stories/20101119272303300.htm) and VJTI
will possibly be among the sadest chapters in the history of modern
Maharashtra. Even in these modern times, TIFR was also forced to locate
two of its very prominent center to Bangalore due to coldness of Mumbai
government towards granting some lands to it - ironically this also did
not make any news in Marathi media. Mumbai, no longer holds sway in
cricket after 1990's. Except for Sachin Tendulkar, there is not a single
worthy player who can find a place in Indian Eleven. It'd be a pity, if
this once a great city where modern trade and  cricket originated, and
science and technology were groomed, which once produced Bhise and
Kokatnur, will be allowed to ruined by super-fascist of money and
politics.\
