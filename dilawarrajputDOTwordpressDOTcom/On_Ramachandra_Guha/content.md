Every generation have its heroes, dead and alive. The dead are
discovered by writing they left behind. Uninitiated people like me
easily get curious about these famous people. Some of us might end up
reading them. In these 'connected' times, it is much more easier to
become famous than it has ever been, save mathematicians. Simply because
only they can understand what they have written.\
\
A newspaper named 'New York Times' which has the habit of using
superlatives prefixed with words like 'arguably' and 'probably'; and
which like Harvard historians find it almost impossible to think beyond
the nations of Atlantis, titled him '**perhaps the best among India's
non fiction writers**'. Now I'll never know why this newspaper uses
weired superlatives when it can use fewer words to make the same point.
May it is American culture, they will only consume the best.  Even it is
'perhaps' or 'arguably' best.\
\
It is always dangerous to write about living beings. Not only because
they might react to what one has written but one run the risk to get
disillusioned should they do something wrong. Or worse, in future your
own changed thinking might become incompatible with them. And since one
can not undone what one have 'done' on-line, these words will haunt you
back. Anyway few will deny the temptation of writing about people they
admire (and thinking about people they fancy) even if my Indian
instincts are better suited for censure and hate. This blog about him,
with all its grammatical flaws and spelling mistakes, is account of my
one sided acquaintanceship with him - of my readings of his writings.
Unlike P. Sainath, I was not able to appreciate him when I read his
'past and present' column in Hindu's Magazine first time. Since he was
writing in Hindu, he must have been some authority in some area. Surely,
this turned out be an underestimate but one should not charge me with
'trivializing' the depth of his mind since his articles in this magazine
were not reflection of his mind but mostly his memoirs.\
\
I was not fortunate enough to read him early in my college days since he
wrote primarily for 'Telegraph' and 'Outlook' and I did not read any of
them. I was a 'Frontline' and 'Hindu' guy. Fortunately in IIT, they will
not brand you 'Leftist' for that. There was a significant charm in his
column of 'past and present'. For me, a teenager with troubled mind with
certain dispositions about his future, his column was like what
['peanuts' were to
America](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/oct/20/peanuts-charlie-brown-charles-m-schulz)
during great depression.  He gave plain truth, if at time it was
sweetened with extra optimism, which open my eyes to a nation in which I
was born and have been deeply ignorant. He did to me what Indian Ocean
did to our music; opened up to the masses.\
\
In March 2008, when I was a
'[matka](http://dilawarsays.blogspot.com/2010/03/on-matka-m-tech-iit-bomaby.html)'
at IIT Bombay, I went to Crossword bookstore in Powai with Swapnil, a
'Bhatka' (B.Tech.) friend. Now in IIT, a M.Tech. and B. Tech. are an odd
couple - whatever permutation of genders. It is unnatural for a M.Tech
for having a B.Tech. friend and it is offensive and undermining for a
B.Tech. to have a M.Tech as a friend. It kind of a caste system on the
campus. After doing a comparative study of Bejan Daruwala's work with
others astrologers for 3-4 hours and picking the best of all of them
about our zodiac signs, we were about to leave when I saw a book titled
'*India After Gandhi*'. I really don't know what struck me, I borrowed
Swapnil debit card and bought the book. I am not quite sure whether I
paid him back!\
\
This was the second book I bought from my own pocket money (if I have
paid Swapnil back). The first one was Sainath's masterpiece '*Everyone
loves a good drought*' which Robin found depressing after finishing one
page. Since this was second novelty in my life which was completely
mine, I sat down to read few pages. I did not have much time. I had to
pack for journey back home. But I read more than 40-50 pages. This is
unexpected from an engineer. Despite of all claims of '*padhe likhe
log'*, engineers show colossal hesitation for reading and writing unless
there is exam or someone is paying them for it. Next day, I took train
for my village with this book in my bag. I did not read this book on the
journey, nor I pretended to read it. I spend my time in trains either by
looking out of windows or sleeping. In village, the '*akhand Ramyanan'*
was going on. A loudspeaker, initially was a feature of Muslim mosque,
is now a integral part of Hindu temples in my area, was making sure that
people in nearby villages get to know who is doing this '*akhand
ramayana'*. Hinduism have been like semiconductor slab, you can dope it
with anything. It will absorb it rather than reject it. Now in villages,
you can use only sunlight to read, I finished this book before they
could finish their Ramayana - even though they have arrangements for
night also. And trust me, it was better than 'Harry Potter'. And yes, I
have read Harry Potter, first 3 books.\
\
Now book reviewer have said a lot about this book. I have seen some
blogs written about this book. The power of his writing can be judges by
an observation, 'whoever read him wants to write like him'. When I gave
this book to Nishant in office, and next week I asked him how much he
have read it, he said, "*I haven't touched it. Dad is reading it for
last 7 days. This is the first time, I am seeing him reading anything
except medical reports."*\
\
After finishing this book and rereading some parts of it many times
after that, I ordered one more book with a scary title,
"*Anthropologists among the Marxists and other essays".* They ask never
to judge a book by its cover, it turned out to be a truism. Now Outlook
said  this about him while reviewing this book,\

> Reading Ram Guha is like listening to a trilling broadcast by Alistair
> Cooke ... No fiction by Amitav Ghosh or Amit Chaudhary has evoked with
> such brevity and wit the soul of a real place, real people .. These
> are pictures in the round, affectionate, malicious people .. Guha's
> faceted little gem shows that light is beginning to glint on Indian
> non-fiction.

\
Till now I have not seen him in person - not even on youtube. One day
while searching his articles on Internet, I discovered that he has given
a talk in Canada and the video is available on  youtube. I shared this
video on this blog and after watching the video, I got carried away and
wrote the following email to electrical engineering dept students.\

     

>     Hi,Ramachandra Guha is author of an acclaimed book on modern Indian History,"India After Gandhi". Recently, he gave a seminar at International DevelopmentResearch Center which is now available at youtube,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVbhB1YjjA0&feature=player_embedded 
>
>     To my knowledge this video is his first talk available in public domain.His articles can be found at http://www.indiatogether.org/opinions/ramguha/as well as in a prominent Marxist Magazine http://www.epw.in---P. Sainath was Roman Magsaysay award 2007 winner for journalism. He is authorof the book "Everyone loves a good drought - stories from the poorest districtof India". He is currently rural affairs editor at an estimable Indiannewspaper 'The Hindu'. His writings can be found athttp://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/ as wellas at http://www.indiatogether.org/opinions/psainath/His talks given in 2005 and later are available athttp://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=9078987899127917834&hl=en#docid=-1560557294503313321I hope few will consider this email Spam.-- DilawarEE Dept.

Two reply came back. One was thankful to me for sharing these links.
Another claimed that 'he enjoyed it throughly'.  Now, 5 days back, on
Dec 19, 2010, I was going to department to give 'e-attendace'. You put
your thumb on a electronic machine. It feels like being an illiterate
since back in village '*angootha chap log*' means illiterate. It would
be better if they let using fingers for that purpose (i.e. fingering the
machine). Anyway, on the way to office, I saw an A4 size notice lying on
the road, '**Interactive session with Ramachandra Guha at FC Kohli
Auditorium**'. On the way to FC Kohli auditorium, I was wondering how
much part that email did play.\
\
It was surprising to learn that IITans invited him. He agreed to come, I
was thrilled. It started half an hour late since a quiz was going on in
the room. During the session, students were more surprised than they
were delighted. And never before I have seen so many IITans asking that
many questions (with an exception of pre-placement talks of banks, but
in per-capita basis he outperformed them too). One of the guy who
responded to my email was sitting on the first bench with brand new
'*India after Gandhi*' asked him, "Why Manmohan Singh is quiet all the
time?" As usual, the most ridiculous sounding questions can only be
satisfied with the wittiest answers. He gave after making sure that the
conversation is not being recorded. Well, I have that in my music
player. One day I might get the chance to blackmail him for a
conversation.  \
\
If one look at his works, his interests are as diverse as the country he
was born in. Once a professor of us passed a remark during lecture,
"*These IITians, they want to touch everything."* Well, that is largely
true for any Indian student. They wants to know something about
everything. Still our universities  put a lot of premium on
'specialization' - 'a form of semi-illiteracy' as D D Koshambi used to
call it. I can only think of only one Indian who, all of his life, have
his mind only on one thing. This Indian was Ramanujan.\
\
I couldn't get mic to ask my question. All I wanted to ask him about
'the makers of Ramachandra Guha'. Though he has written about them -
contributor to his 'intellectual growth' - I missed the joy listening
about them. Finally coming back to IIT Bombay for Ph.D. paid off. You
don't get to listen to these kind of people everyday - at least, off the
Internet. \
