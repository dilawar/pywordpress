I had to migrate this blog from
[http://dilawarsays.blogspot.in/](http://dilawarsays.blogspot.in/) to
here. I deleted my all old social-media profiles, including google. I
couldn't keep blogger profile alone. Apologies to my regular readers. I
have used wordpress before for writing my technical blogs . Its
interface is cleaner and better than blogspot. I was reluctant to move
this blog from blogspot to here for sake of loosing readership. What
what one can do? With google, its a package deal; either everything or
nothing at all. I started this blog during my post-graduation. I used to
write anything random appeared on my mind. But these days I only write
about my society and my experiences in this world. Older posts on this
blog may not be compatible with my views these days. They do have some
personal emotional appeal to me. This is why they are still here and are
not updated or deleted. Please feel free to drop a comment. I may not be
able to reply quickly, but I will get back to you as soon as I get time.
