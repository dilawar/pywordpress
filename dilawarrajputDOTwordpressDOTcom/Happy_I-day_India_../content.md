There was a time when she was a mother who cared about all of her
children. Even in the early day's of her Independence, when she had
little to feed all of her children. she managed really well. [These
days, she only cares about her children who look beautiful. She has long
tuned her back on the children who look
ugly](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=9078987899127917834#) (as
a rule of thumb, villagers and migrant workers). Tribals had never been
her favorites.  Even in the time of great king *Ashoka* they were known
as '*trouble maker*'.\
\
By the way, most of us farmers and laborer are oblivion to this facts
that she no longer feel our pain. Bloody stupid people, still have the
same romantic views of India as Nehru had about her. There are people
who call spade a spade but who have access to their writings. First of
all, they do write in English (I plead guilty) and regional media does
not like them anyway since they can not have an advertisement if they
are going to give them space. It is perhaps an irony of ours that even
though we are the only one who vote government in and out, still they do
not seem to care about us. All these urbane middle class get their ways
even though they never vote. Anyway.. \
\
We celebrated her Independence in the best way we could. For my father,
this day did not matter much for he shaped his world-views (or
regional-views) what he saw and felt by himself. He, like most of the
not-so-educated farmers do not wonder about this world. They simply know
how this world work. This quality is missing in our educated or
'curious' friends. They do wonder a lot and get confused. My mother,
though less educated than my father, deliberately refuse to live in
reality. She trust radio more than what she sees. What she heard on
radio is like old time '*akashvani*' which has to be true. If they say
that there are golden days ahead for India, so it must be true. *Prasar
Bharti* is anyway more sensible then all of other channels put together.
She always enjoy the I-day, probably today also she must have felt
happiness larger than other days. For her, it is a special day. Today,
first on Doordarshan, she would watch that impressive parade and then
cook something special perhaps '*suji ka halwa'.*Then she'd call be and
ask me to wake up and take a bath as early as possible but today my
incoming are barred. That must have reduced her happiness.\
\
In those childhood days, there were our teachers. They liked this day
too. Everyone of them used to come on time on this days in the best
possible clothes. Then we'd march in village chanting slogans of freedom
fighters and watch the movie on DD in afternoon.\
\
In my childhood, like every other children, I was not critical. In our
school library, we did not have Arundhati Roy or George Orwell (Yes, the
Hindi translation. I think there wasn't any). We had all the stuff which
make you fall in love with India. We had *Chacha Nehru*. We had
Vivekananda. We even had Gandhi. But we did not have all the people who
lived in villages and have not-so-romantic views about India. We did not
have anything written by Ambedkar or Patel. I lived in my small village
in my own daydreams shaped by all the popular people about all the
popular things - no space for pessimism.\
\
Then there were cities.\
\
This was the time I start reading elite English newspapers on regular
basis. In Chennai, now when I think about it - I was fortunate enough
that they could maintain a newspaper like "*The Hindu*". In our north
India, our largest read newspaper does not have a book- review page.
Less I say is better about this *Times of Idiots.*I already had a lot of
garbage in my head filled by corporate media. I did not realize that
news now mean how many click you can get on it or how much advertisement
you can put around it and editors and journalists have been replaced by
managers and stenographers. I appreciated this '*bazaru*' views after
all I was dreaming to earn my future bread and butter from this
'*bazar*' only in which I did succeed. I plead guilty.\
\
During my U.G. in Chennai, in the "*Communication Skills*" exam, teacher
asked me to interpret an article. There is something I could still
remember. Someone was saying about their Russian newspaper.\

> "Oh! Our Newspapers,  There is truth on sport page, half truth on
> business page and lies everywhere." ..... "Editorials! Ah, what you
> mean is the page by which we separate our advertisements."

 And now Mark Twain was making sense to me...\

> **Yours was not, in the beginning, a criminal nature, but
> circumstances changed it. At the age of nine, you stole sugar. At the
> age of fifteen, you stole money. At twenty, you stole horses. At
> twenty-five, you committed arson. At thirty, hardened in crime, you
> became an editor.**

 My own experiences with readings showed me how much I believed in
newspapers even though my own experience was not agreeing with them at
all. I simply refused my experiences. I hated not-educated people. I
hated those villagers in the belief that they are the bottleneck in our
growth and without them we could have long become "*Tiger Economy*" (I
dont know why the name it like this when the real 'Tiger' is getting
extinct). Yes, give their land to Reliance of Tata and let us have the
riches person on the earth then we'll feel like the leader in the world.
These ugly looking people does not know the difference between 'hard'
and 'smart' and do not appreciate the concept of 'profit' -[I could have
cited some Nobel Laureate of
Economics.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/oct/08/economics-nobel-women-bailout-stockmarket)
Why they work so hard for so less? Rational game theory! Even though I
knew the answers. I lived there for 16 years and have the first hand
experience how things work in rural India. Perhaps the urge to become
the English speaking elite (with at least two accent, one is for home
and one is for outside) was too strong to get blinded. Media tell us
what we like to read or listen, they are much different from
politicians. They is also a necessity for them. You know, if you tell
people something they already know they thank you for  it. [Tell them
something they do not know, they will hate you for
it.](http://www.monbiot.com/) They can not make huge profit if they
start pissing off their readers. Someone else will take their place. See
out largest selling English newspaper (*Times of India),*sexuality oozes
out of it very first page. \
\
I did not like people opposing so-called development. I liked the idea
that someone has to suffer for development but I never asked myself why
always only poor have to suffer. There was massive cuts in rural health
and food security programs (they call it subsidy) but they give over 60
lacs a minute for corporates (and call it incentives). [And still they
call every budget farmer
friendly](http://beta.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/article123884.ece?homepage=true).\
\
All the success stories about India is true but the other story which[P.
Sainath](http://www.indiatogether.org/opinions/psainath/) pains to tell
is also very true. But we are living in a [time of history in which
concern for poor is slowly
declining](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CB4QFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2F94.126.106.9%2FDocuments%2Fpublications1%2Fpublic-attitudes-april10.pdf&ei=X_dnTPWdNcL38AaHlcC3BA&usg=AFQjCNEXayepveN4NVaJZVCf8zAJFmNURQ&sig2=WT2iww_gL6Ep2awHNk219g)
and India, having empathy for ugly looking people may be the lowest in
the world (Remember here everyone loves to own a costliest fairness
cream. Yes, even the men. Ask Saharukh Khan if you find hard to believe
it). [With an exception of old Tata, we never had generous rich. Our
beloved billionaires (unless they are old Banglorian) do not build
university or hospitals for people who are in
need](http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2010/04/26/why-dont-indians-give-more/).
They may like to build helli-pads and all. And you know, in India,
whenever a rich person wants to do anything they need government support
and they hate to admit in public that they are living on charity. If
someone from them like Narayan Murthy felt the pain and hit back at
their counterparts, he suddenly found himself ostracized by corporate
media - Now, Nanden Nilekani is their faviorite. Once their beloved P.M.
Manmohan also asked these rich people to cut down their salaries. Holy
crap! Suddenly whole of the media went against him. *Pay peanuts and get
monkey*, they were chanting. No! *Pay gold and get Gorillas*. Someone
could have asked before.\
\
I still find it unbelievable how many Indians choose to ignore the
massive poverty in India. How many of them find it very hard to digest
that 770 million (75%) of Indians lives below Rs. 20 day. Some even say
that some pissed of leftist came up with these terms even [if the
figures are put up on government
websites](http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSDEL218894) by
government. It is well known in academic circles but if a person who can
read a bit should know that much about a land which he/she calls his/her
mother. Perhaps the empathy and sympathy is not a typical element of
Indians. Even the better half of them, Indian female, have not produced
a single Mother Theresa. We have produced *Baba Amte* (We still have not
given him *Bharat Ratna*. By the way, We respect rich and powerful and
the missile makers). Among the female politicians, only one who seems to
concerned about poor or female is Italian born *Sonia Gandhi*.\
\
It is really easy to become cynic in India and Indians can be very
exasperating at times.  Whatever you can say about India, its opposite
is also equally true. I have liking for dissidents for anything
significant ever come to this world came from dissidents. This is the
first requirement to do something new, you must find old picture
imperfect. If you want to feel disconnected there are a lot of
philosophy. These poverty problem can be seen in many ways. Like, "Over
a billion people, of course they are poor. No one have unlimited
resources." You can still go to the higher label, "I worry about bigger
things like universe. Humans are not worth worrying about." But one
thing is for sure, no matter what you do or what you think, One should
keep in mind, less one consume is better of others. You need not care
about others if you do not mind when they stop caring about you. Like
Naxals!\
\
I can not say that India fails her children on all accounts - on most of
the accounts  she does. I was able to make to the its one of the most
elite Institute even though I was not suppose to. But these are few
incidents. You can not capture the reality - but you can pollute the
reality by citing them.The best thing about I like about India that She
gives hope to all of her children. Even *Arundhati Roy* have not lost
her mind - she still seems to be hopeful. About Indians, I like their
disaster management capabilities. As a race, I do not have very high
opinion about Indians. They do not have those "conqueror"  attitude. At
best they choose the best possible option available. Perhaps that is why
We were able to survive. Greeks did not. Spartan failed. You know, its
the tigers and lions which get extinct. Dogs and pests never get
extinct. At large, Indian change their views as the time wants them to
be. Remember your childhood when you did not like the idea leaving you
motherland if given a chance. Now?\
\
I have not doubt about her survival, but would she be able to live? I am
always doubtful, yet hopeful!  \
