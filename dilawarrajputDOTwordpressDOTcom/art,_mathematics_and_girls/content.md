Well that could be the article of the century. Lets start from art, i
believe that art is somewhat cojugate to nature. What we are lacking in
nature, human mind somehow intrigued by it and abstractly created this
divine discipline. See the mordern building, artifects around you, all
essentially have corners or sharp geometry which nature lacks, natural
music is essentially chaotic and random ( most of the poet call it music
like bird's cipper, waterfall sound etc), while human music is governed
by some rules ( some would like to argure about hip-hop and rap music,
that also have certain rhythm.). With the advances in chaos theory, this
theory may collapse one day. Well, till then who cares. Now mathematics
which is generally belived as a language to describe nature. As i
earlier said nature is complement and/or conjugate to art, girls
generally dont like mathematics ( as a language of nature, conjugate of
art ) because they like art first. I think i solved a mystry and deserve
a nobel prize ( or atleast ignobel. :-) )\
There could be one more argument, i believe women are more developed
than men as far as human development is considered. They imbibe the more
human natures, well that i need not to explain, if you are girl u know
it and often proudly flaunt it, and if you are a boy than also u know it
at least from your mom. These all human feelings requires your heart to
dominate over your mind ( don't get into the biology of these parts ),
thats why girls weep a lot more than boys do after a breakup, i have
seen boys weeping or sobbing too but they dont show it, it is not
considered manly. Girls can do it, may flaunt it too. Mathematics such a
logical subject where there sould not be a place for emotions will
hardly get any girl interested by herself. Well, there is no question of
someone ability to do well in math, its just a matter of liking. If
girls can do wonder with art which in itself is the most abstract
subject, why cant it be in abstract algebra.\
Some eminent scholars have argued that all the subjects are essentially
a part of the divine subject ( i too somehow believe it), taken this
into account, All is bullshit! the bug stops here!
