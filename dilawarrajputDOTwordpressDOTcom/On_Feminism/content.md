Feminism means different thing to different people. These meanings are
sometimes diagonally opposite. If for some equal rights, if not more,
are the ultimate aim for feminism; others are willing to give up some
rights if it guarantees that idea of 'family' will not get undermined.
Not only most of the men, but a substantial number of the women - even
university educated one who are first beneficiary of feminism - are
hostile to feminism. Some of them see it as an out-dated and stuffy (esp
where MTV/TOI rules) idea while for others, it has become a playground
of extremists, and like fundamentalism and communism, it has nothing
useful to say for them. They also feel that it has become
'institutionalized' and it asks for conformism to its rules and
regulation, and thus it has turned into some sort of communism.\

'**When a woman life becomes empty, she longs for a man's love.**' said
one early feminists. In this view of feminism, men are rendered as
cold-hearted exploiters. Another modern one says, "**They call me
feminists whenever I try to differentiate myself from a doormat or a
prostitute.**" Between these two statements lies a complex social
history behind feminism.\
\
This books shown in picture traces the evolution of feminism in England
and gives some useful historical facts. It does not explore, due to the
limitation on its size, why feminists are scorned at by their own sex.
On these matter there is very nice book review available
[here](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/nov/20/rachel-cusk-the-female-eunuch).
'**If feminism failed to transform the private lives of women'**said
reviewer because women considered and still considering feminism '**as
too uncompromising, as involving too much exposure, too much conflict at
a personal level'.**  On top of it, it demands that woman should be
'**insensitive, in a way, to other people by making the private somehow
public**'.\
\
In India, picture has not been that scary for middle class women. The
relative sanity of Indian civilization is due to the lack of  idea of
Satan and Witch. No Eve and Serpent was there in our mythology. But
surely, our picture is disappointing esp among the educated woman who
looks much weaker than their uneducated counterpart in India. I can say
with some surety that rural women, with little or no education, [are
much stronger than their urbane
counterpart](http://www.indiatogether.org/2011/mar/rbs-women.htm). What
is more depressing is to see young educated girls, low on their self
esteem, longs for  flowers than laurels.\

Unlike western world, in India, feminism was started by men and has been
constantly supported thereafter. In my generation, most of the educated
females are not even aware what feminism stands for. I haven't heard any
girl talking about feminism in any given day or time. It was not at all
surprising to notice that 'International Woman Day' [passed without any
serious discussion in
India](http://thehoot.org/web/home/story.php?storyid=5174&mod=1&pg=1&sectionId=10&valid=true).\
\
Some have argued that the Western feminism can not be imported into
India without modification. They say that it should be seen as 'human
right' at beast. More on this distinction, among other things, can be
found [here](http://www.jstor.org/stable/463929).  
\
Despite of eloquent praise of women in our literature, sacred text and
laws, the constant tutelage of women is visible in every public domain.
Despite of all this, feminist are mostly jeered at by other women. One
can only wish that '**these younger women feel differently in ten years
or so, when they will find themselves juggling family, hoousework, and a
job**'. They may also realise that '**they need to re-invent feminism to
suit their own experience.**' And they better reinvent it. You can not
become a woman without having a clear definition of feminism.
