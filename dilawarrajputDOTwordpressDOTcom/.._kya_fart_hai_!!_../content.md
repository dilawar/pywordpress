Uff.. this is the placement time. First phase is over and I am jobless.
I wrote all the tests and gave all the stupid interviews. Interviews, to
those guys .. I dont like them. Neither I want to be like them.. They
asked all the standard and diplomatic question and I answered all
honestly. Not with complete honesty.. otherwise they'd have thrown me
out. But I want a job.. well paid so I can pay back my load asap and go
on to do my doctorate. Now, it seems It may take 2 years to pay back
it.. and I am tense.. First I have to do the things I dont like. Now
GATE is valid only for 1 year. This year score wont work next year..
what a crap!!\
\
I dont like giving exams and the worst is giving interviews to the
people I dont wanna be. What a stupid life.. Due to all of these, I
didnt write TIFR exam for doctorate. :-(\
\
Now mamma is insisting joining DRDO/ISRO and dad is whatever is
respectful. Younger brother wants to me to join the highest paid one and
my elder brother wants me to know my girlfriend name. hmmmmm..\
\
Tomorrow one more test and interview.. ahh.. I dont want to go.. Ok.. I
have to be.. though I have choices but I am not comfortable to make
them.. I have to go for a job. After I am done with the loan .. :-) I
dont give a damn.. what anyone thinks .. anyone means my family.. others
do not matter !!\
\
ok.. blah blah is over.. Its took me 20 years to kill the inferior
feelings. Now after this placement spree, this has started germinating
once again. I dont want it. Its really harmful!! gotta protect myself!!
:-) lets see....\
\
I am getting addicted to X-files and Ubuntu... linux is wonderful and
Windows is as stupid.. hehe\
\
Jyoti is wondering why i didn't get the job on the very first day. Boka
was being boka.. telling why did I join IIT. Cancer is asking me to go
to US for doctorate AS IT'D SOLVE ALL OF MY PROBS. good scholarship..
pay back my loan and all... I want to join TIFR,CMI or IMSc.. actually
.. i wanna doctorate here.. Now I dont want to go anywhere. I consumed
resources here, I'll compensate them too here. Its not patriotism or
something. it's all belief. unfortunately, I have to be someone whom I
never wanna be for a year or so. All I wish I dont lay off my eyes on
the things I always wanted to have. These days I am not even writing my
diary.. Things are bit disturbing these days. :-(
