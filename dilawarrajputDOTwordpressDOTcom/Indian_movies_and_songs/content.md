So wrote the legendary film maker Satyajit Ray about Hindi movies.
Unlike Hindi movies of his days, Satyajit Ray took his viewers to the
real life of his characters, showing the food they ate and clothes they
wore. The life his protagonists led were simple and utterly and
compellingly real. Ray's movies were different from Hindi movies in
their outlook and theme, yet they had songs. Although fewer than it's
counterpart. So why songs are so important in all Indian movies? Hindi
movies without songs are rare. Naujawan, Munna, Kanoon, Pushpak, Achanak
and Black are perhaps only movies without any song in them. And I doubts
if there are many Indian movies without songs in other languages. In
1937, when Naujawan (Wadia Movietones) was released without a single
song in it, a reporter reported how people reacted to this 'experiment'.
In Jubliee Cinema Delhi, where is movie was premiered the audience went
on rampage, breaking chairs and shouting 'Wadia ne loot liya' (Wadia has
robbed us); the film had to be temporarily withdrawn. Such a strong
protest forced the producers to insert a trailer before the film to
explain why there was no song in it. Why did people find it hard to
accept 'a movie without songs'? Ashok Ranade who did seminal work on
Hindi Film Songs gave an explanation.  'Historically Indian cinema
relied on the heritage of Indian theatre which is built on the
intertwining of the 'drishya' (visual) and 'shravya' (aural), giving
rise to musical drama.' [1] And music has to be an integral part of any
drama. This is a 'traditional image' of drama. Movies, a new avatar of
drama, must have songs in it. And Indians do not find it easy to
tolerate something which varies from its traditional image whether it is
a movie without a songs or a girl in western clothes. Movies without
songs were not recieved well in the past. It can all change now. A
section of Indian population with significant purchasing power is
comfortable with Western movies which rarely have songs in them. A
Indian movie can now claim its existence without any song. A song and
the way it is sung by protagonists, makes Hindi movies more surreal than
they already are. But Hindi movies do not claim to be a 'portrait of
reality'. In 1970, Manmohan Desai, said of his works that he 'want[s]
people to forget their misery,.. [he] want[s] to take them into a dream
world where there is no poverty, where there is no beggars, where fate
is kind and God is busy looking after his flock'

And it worked well! Peasant and workers went to movies for the same
reason as, back in 19th century, a new literate and working class in
England chose to read stories about rich and the famous. As a character
in a [George Gissing's
novel](http://books.google.com/books?id=Nq9SCDhI8UsC&pg=PA378&lpg=PA378&dq=nothing+can+induce+working+men+and+women+to+read+%2B+gissing&source=bl&ots=wV6hpENR0y&sig=OyRbNJOASIs9OjSarNKKc0yHFDo&hl=en&ei=SBXJTtvDFIPirAf2pPCdDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=nothing%20can%20induce&f=false)says,
"Nothing can induce working men  and women to read stories that treat
their own world. They are the most consummate idealists in creation,
especially the women ... The working class detest anything that tries to
represent their daily life." No wonder, most of Indian newspapers which
are competing with television to become the source of entertainment,
chose to to ignore reality. Only 'farse and melodrama', wrote Gissing,
went down well with the British working class. Same can be said about
Indians with the farce and melodrama being indianised. Hindi movies are
changing in their outlook. They no longer boast 'stories of struggle' or
'a protagonist struggling to live a life of virtue'.  Although [there
have been exceptional
cases.](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/Harsh_Mander/article80638.ece)
Today's character are not virtuous young men and women or poor people
struggling to make a living with dignity. They have been replaced by
NRIs and middle classes. Their inspirations are projected as the
inspirations of the nations and they set what should be seen modern or
proper and what as backward. Movies are the best repositories of their
changing inspirations. Despite of such rapid changes in outlook, as far
as songs are concerned Indian movies have remained largely the same.
'Indian audience', writes film Historian Nasreen Munni Kabir, are
'resigned to stock characters and predictable dialogues'. But they know,
and hope, that these 'tried old stories' can yet be 'brought back to
life by good-looking stars and six or eight great songs'. These
movie-goers 'can accept repetition in story-lines, but they 'will reject
a film music if it has no originality' [5]. Those who are seeing a lot
of item-numbers in Indian movies these days may find this observation
somewhat premature. NOTES : [1] Hindi Film Songs : Music Beyond
