When I was a kid, I was a fan of '[Vividh
Bharati](http://www.allindiaradio.org/vb.html)'. This radio station
transmits its programs from Mumbai. It is under 'Prasar Bharti'. Every
day, from 8:30 pm to 8:45 pm, they used to broadcast a 12-15 minute
drama called '*Jhalki*' just before the 'Samachar Sandhya (evening
news).'\
\
"Chottu" was one of those 'Jhalki' which I'd never forget. *Chottu*means
'little one' in English. *Jhalki*means 'a glimpse' literally, but it
stands for 'a small drama on radio'.\
\
"I do not have any problem with this name", said the protagonist on the
radio, "I hate what it stand for." He meant child labor. Child labor in
India is very big problem. Indians, both as a society and as a
government are indifferent to this problem though they seem to worry
about it a lot. A new law has been passed recently banning all forms of
child-labor. Quite interestingly, one of the contributor in forming this
law is an economist who wrote in New York Times titled “The Poor Need
Child Labour” (November 29, 1994). Where he admitted to having had a
13-year-old work in his home. (And who also favoured the decontrolling
of fuel prices — to tackle the price rise, no less. And perhaps to help
child labour, too?)\
\
If we consider, according to this law, what constitute child labor then
almost all of us had done child-labor at some time or other. I am a
farmer son. Though my father never took me to fields at the expense of
school (unlike most of us farmer's children) but I never had my Sundays
and holidays spared. I, along with my brothers, had to work in fields.
We considered it daily routine. The idea of labor, in this sense, was
not that developed in us that time.\
\
This J*halki*was about a kid named *Chottu*who met the protagonist of
this *jhalki* in train selling peanuts. Everyone was calling him by the
name of *Chottu* (the little one) without bothering anything else about
him. He was reduced to a *Chottu*. In India, If you are a child and on
the street selling things (a sight on Indian roads as common as
the-great-spit of North India, no pun intended), *Chottu* is what you
are supposed to be called.\
\
Any public-spirited Indian will tell you how ugly this problem is.
However, everyone is convinced that problem is way to complicated to be
solved by some law only. True!\
\
Well, how many Chottu do you know? I have seen many. The kid who brings
lunches to my office. The kid who sells *chai* outside the office. The
paratha-maker. The corn seller. The one who is delivering newspaper. How
many of those you have employed? Its not a crime if you ask me to give
someone job in need. Do they have other options? I don't think so. But
should We, whose lives are much easier, not be concerned about their
wellbeing? The point is how many children We have exploited for our
benefits? At whose cost, we are letting it happen? Shouldn't it the
responsibility of a self-respecting society to take care of its
children? If no, then it not a responsibility of these *chottu* to take
care of society, to consider our well being when they have the
capabilities of hurting us for their benefits as we are doing now.\
\
But what'd you do after taking away labor from Chottu? Have you consider
a home for them before striping them from their footpath? Have you
helped building a school for them before throwing them out of their
current job? Do you have any alternatives? Or it is just fashionable to
bar child-labor? Or you do  not like the idea that this rising
tiger-economy can have child labor? Lets make them someone else but
Chottu.\
\
Rather, it creates more problem than solving it. US barred the carpet
import from Bangladesh on the ground that these guys use child labour.
What happened, there was a increase in the child-prostitutions. Everyone
needs to eat. Hunger is much worse than slavery.  Do you have any
solutions how to solve this problem? I dont!\
\
Let me tell you some stories of Chottu. No it'd be worthless. These
stories have been told all along. Almost all of them say the same thing
(Or maybe my heart can not feel what it should feel). There is no escape
from it till economy is not revived and the education is expanded at
much higher pace. It's the public sympathy which is need-of-time to
confront this problem.\
\
Can We have  a child-labor free India? At the most optimistic level, I
can say, "May be if and only if all of Indian feel that yes, it is a
problem, else this thing will continue as it is." Great things happen
slowly in nature. It is to be solved by evolution not by revolution.\
\
Till, we can ask them what is their name and call them by that. One must
allow the basic dignity to a person one seems to care about.
