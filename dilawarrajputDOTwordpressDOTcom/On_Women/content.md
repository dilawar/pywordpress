Women, in general, have attracted the imagination of probably all of the
men. They have been quite successful in altering the neural path in
almost all of us and have been major cause of turning some of the
lunatics in to finest scholars (e.g. Tulsidas and Kalidas) and we
probably never know how many were ruined vice versa since nobody keep
tracks of loosers. If there are N men alive, guaranteed that they will
come up at least N\^N views about women in their total lifetime, mostly
contradictory at times. Some of the finest male brains have pondered
over the questions of women and found themselves miserably inept at
solving this riddle. In their life time, if some of them compared all
beautiful and elegant things with women, many of them have devised a
huge number of words which are mostly of disapproving nature. Well,
there have been many extreme cases which can not be true. Like in *Braj
Bhasa* dialect of Hindi, in *Ritikavya tradition of poetry*, these guys
were over obsessive with female body parts. They compared anything
beautiful with woman. Some of them have gone up to the level comparing
mountains with female breasts. Scary man! What kind of image they had in
mind? Boobzilla!!\
\
Among few of them I've read, Einstein knew very well about the
complexity of subject he was handling. As a wise man, he used humor
while talking about women. One of the finest thinker in East Asian human
history,
*[Confusios](http://www.womeninworldhistory.com/lesson3plus.html)*have
said things about woman which would make him no 1 enemy of feminist (of
whatever kind). His least popular depreciation of woman has been one the
most fundamental of his thinking, "*Women and people of low birth are
very hard to deal with. If you are friendly with them, they get out of
hand, and if you keep your distance, they resent it.*" Quite ironically,
another Chinese, Mao Zedong, was of the view that in China woman "*hold
up half the sky*". The comparison don't sit easily given the fact the
Confucius still touched deep chord in Chines society. However, in a move
that would have the sage himself raising a disapproving eyebrow,
feminism is being introduced to Confucianism with the recent decision to
recognise, for the first time, women as descendants of the philosopher.
Anyway, 2400 years is a big time.\
\
Back to our India which have its both glorious and dirty history in the
matter of women. Manu's views are probably well known. He might have
become best friend of Confucius. They both have love to spend time over
tea discussing ills of women company.\
\
None of them, however, denied the role woman plays in shaping up a
society. Even Manu and Confucius were well aware of the fact that
precursor of a society downfall is degradation of woman. Probably that
is why they came up with these regressive ideas. Centuries later,
Napoleon  summed it up in his famous, "*Give me good mothers, I'll give
you a great nation."*. In *Mahabharta*, a great deal of arguments were
made only on women role in a society. Woman agency, as Amartya Sen
discussed in his *Argumentative Indians* was the topic of discussion
between Krishna and Arjuna in which Arjuna was worried about the
degradation of their character will lead to their kingdom destruction.
In fact, the flow of this tale *Mahabharata* is governed by women only.
My favorite part have always been in which Kunti encounters Karna
revealing that he is her son. This instant was well captured by
*Ramdhari Singh Dinker* in his *Rashmirathi.*\

The degradation of women in India after Brahmans took over Hinduism was
colossal and also very much acknowledged. Among some of the good things
(in my opinion) which came out of it was strong family. Unfortunately,
to make this institute sustainable, women were forced to give up so many
rights than was necessary. A lot of things changed in this time. Like as
in Mahabharta, it was a warrior duty to not to refuse a woman if she
wants a son from him. Sex have always been a whirlpool around which a
lot of philosophy born and perish. \
\
\
In Hindu religion, there are lot of goddess (devi). Prominent are three.
But they are not [central
deity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Goddess). In spite of their
power, knowledge and wealth, they had been married (or denied
individuality in letter and spirit) to the three gods, the trinity.
Perhaps, that did not serve the purpose
of*[Manuvadi](http://hinduism.about.com/library/weekly/aa051303a.htm)*.
A fearsome, uncontrolled *devi* was made a *biwi,*an uncontrolled power
had to be subjugated. Then they fabricated a sense of morality out of
it. Oldest Indian civilization, [Indus civilization has some sort of
central
deity](http://www.svabhinava.org/Dialogues/SarasvatiUnicorn/index.php).
Since Indus script is still un-deciphered its hard to say exactly how
these deity were treated and perceived; whether they were total
independent or considered as 'the other half'.\
\
Perhaps world could have been better off in gender-equality if the deity
were left only *devi*and the the status of *Biwi* could be an additional
one . One should be attached with the least number to identities. It
makes life harder to create an identity for oneself otherwise.\
\
Almost all of the religions have shown a remarkable homogeneous approach
towards woman. I am quite amazed how effectively they have stole power
from women. How they were able to control the other gender, women (as
mother and wife)? Whenever religion peaks at its height, woman will find
themselves at their lowest. In one of my favorite literally work by
Orhan Pamuk, *Snow* a lady told the protagonist,*"When men turn to
religion, women turn to suicide."* If does not make sense to you, get a
copy!\
\
Bernard Shaw and Oscar Wilde have also spoken mildly about woman -
through their alter ego. I do believe that *if you try to get close to a
woman, they will try to take away almost everything from you. Your
freedom to think, your freedom to be bold.* For a normal person who
cherish normal life, company of a woman is possibly the best company.
But most of the philosophers and thinker have avoided woman as expected.
However in the century we are living in, its quite ironical that **most
romantic singers were either single or gay.**** ****Something got to be
wrong with woman. **Take Bernard Shaw for instant, "*It is assumed that
a woman must wait, motionless, until she is wooed ... She often does
wait motionless. That is how a spider waits for the fly. But the spider
spins her web. And if the fly, like my hero, shews the strength that
promise to extricate him, how swiftly does she abandon her pretence of
passiveness, and openly fling coil after coil about him until he is
secured for ever."* A picture of woman-hood as articulated by Prof.
Mehta in the novel *Godan* by Premchand, Shaw probably had the same
picture in his mind "*all men of genius who have contributed anything
original in the true sense of the word have qualities of altruism and
self-sacrifice that are the embodiments of true womanhood."*It is also
worth noticing, most of the males who chose to stay single are those who
have quite extraordinary views about woman.\
\
\
Whatever acquaintanceship I had in my brief period of life - generally
speaking - I am not a big fan of Indian women . I refuse to believe that
they are any better than Indian men. In boldness and patriotism,
probably they are the best in the world. We had (have) Lakshmi Bai,
Panna Dhai, Arundhati Roy, Irom Sharmila, Indira Gandhi, Padmini,
Mayawati and not to mention larger than life figures of Ramayana and
Mahabharata etc. In boldness and patriotism, Indian males, however have
shown a tremendous decline. We no longer have equivalent of Gandhi,
Nehru, Tagore and Bhagat Singh - not even distant one. **Unfortunately
Indian mothers no longer make their children bold, they make them wise.
By being wise, they mean be opportunistic for their benefits. **When it
comes to power and corruption, both of them shows a tremendous appetite.
Just look at the profile of any Indian politicians, male or female.
Compassion is 'a missing' among both of them. Its quite easy in India to
feel disconnected with almost anything. Indians, especially in this
century will not be known for compassion unless one take only corporate
media as the primary source of their research in distant future. Some
times I wonder if I reborn to become a historian and write about this
period taking clues Times of India and other right wing media, I
probably call it the *golden age of India*. Though I know now very well
that Rome is burning and over a billion Nero are playing flutes.\
\
They say that putting a large number of women in prominent positions
will make a difference - due to their compassion with other women. I
highly doubt that.  There are so many women in media, both in national
and international, and there is hardly any change in the way women are
being depicted over there.\
\
\
Besides a country with over half a billion woman have not produced a
Mother Terasa or Any Besant. Or our media fail to acknowledge them if
any? The only politicians in India who really seem to care about poor
people or woman is an Italian born Sonia Gandhi. Despite the opposition
(even from Mamta Banerjee) she successfully implemented Women
Reservation Bill and NREGA. A good thing about Indian men and women is
that both of them are crazy about family. Possibly, in my opinion,
Indian males are best suited for Russian females. Russian woman seems to
worry about a lot about low investment their males put in their family.
Besides Russian Woman are known for their agency and living life with
less stress. You doubt me, look at the difference in life expectancy of
Russian male and female. Over 12 years and most of the males dies due to
over consumption of alcohol. Dudes, Don't chicken out with life!\
\
\
I can not locate any parallel in animal kingdom, in which, in a single
species so much mistrust exists between male and female despite of
living so closely for so many centuries. They sometimes claim that woman
are from this planet and man are form that planet. A growing number of
homosexuals, divorces, breakups and domestic violence shows this
phenomenon. It surely will not auger well for us. A rising tide of
individuality and profit driven attitude have already taken a toll on
relations. "W*hats there for me?"*possibly the first question people ask
themselves before committing themselves to a relation*.*Among these all
mindless (or wise?) pursuit, agitation and ego clashing - sometimes
fueled by good intentions - always put our biggest investment, our
children - at risk. All the wars for gender equality or for whatever
must be fought outside the home. Peace and harmony must prevail in home.
There is need to acknowledge that families are irreplaceable - by both
of the genders. Feminism - though there are thousands of definitions -
must come to the term of motherhood and family. Males are not equipped
with to take care of their children better than their mothers. The idea
of equality between male and female is misplaced. Man and Woman can not
be equal. One can not be equal to a part when one is born a part apart!
 This kind of arguments in which a male shows his incompetencies dealing
with children and family affairs make some woman angry. Why is it only
my job to care of family and children? Well, I don't know! You should
ask your children. With whom they want to be around, their mother of
their father?\

\

Writing in Hindu,[R.
Vasavi](http://beta.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/article60775.ece),
has this to say, "*Women are a rare species as they are the only
non-living creatures inhabiting the earth. Their lifelessness is visible
in their eyes. They are the only species in the entire world who do not
want to give birth to their own kind and have an instinct to kill their
own kind, a characteristic known as ‘female infanticide’ in scientific
terminology"*. In killing daughters, these children of Manu
and Confucius knows no limit. \
\
\
Television has done whatever it could to make the mistrust more acute
between the genders. Look at any drama on Indian television. We never
had so many female villains. Every in-laws is trying to kill her Bhabhi,
every secretary is in some lewd relation with her boss and every
mother-in-law is to her Bahu is more than what Lax Luthor is to
Superman. Now if it is a movie, you get out of the theater and forget
the villain (save Gabbar Singh), but the e[ffect of small screen can not
be ruled
ou](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/article859779.ece)t.
Almost all of these  Indian woman spends so much time in front of it, I
really shudder at the thought marrying someone who have spend a
significant portion of her life in front of this idiot box.\

Possibly the most spineless Indian women are found among the followers
of media and television who shapes their worldview reading and watching
them and mostly concentrated in Indian cities (see End Note on
this). Print media on the other hand, use sex as the strategy to inflict
more disaster. Whenever they talk about women, Sex is always the topic
in background. Barring some sensible newspapers and magazines, there is
hardly an article to be found in which woman are treated as individual
human. Not even a single article, even if written by a female, speaks
only for woman, as an independent entity where a male or Sex is not in
background. Most of them are about relationships, how to deal with man
and blah blah. Can they devote a small space where a woman can really
talk to a woman or the woman are dumb enough to understand that. You can
not blame males here, Indian media have fair share of females at
prominent positions. Some other peculiarities are also observed in this
species. Lets go back to Vasavi, "*Women are the only ones who willingly
allow all kinds of nasty and cruel things to happen to their bodies in
the name of enhancing beauty. This phenomenon can be observed in every
part of the world and throughout history. If the women belonging to
primitive societies wear heavy copper rings around their necks to “look
beautiful” according to their social and cultural code, others who
belong to the modern world wear high heels (which are of course lower
than hills) for the same reason. Neither of them is bothered about the
resultant health hazards."*\
\
So called Market is running a big scam to manipulate girls. Media is in
hand in hand with it so is TV. Market expect you to be low on your
dignity, submissive to its authority. It's champion will attach moral to
it, so you don't even criticise it. The media, News-papers, A, B,
C,..,M...,Z TV; feminine magazine makes you believe that depicting you
as an object is the sole purpose of your existence. They make you
'heroine' for that - which mostly means being a damsel in distress to be
rescued or to sit motionless in bat to be wooed by a good for nothing
male. They give you titles 'Miss Universe' to enjoy more naked shows so
next day they can sell it to people. They call it beauty and art. Women
scientist and engineer do not make the headlines. They do not give
awards to great mother, great wives, or great sister. These roles are
not good! "*No these are subjugation of one gender towards other gender.
This is slavery! Women must break away their barrier and must become an
object to please manhood. Spending time with her children and making a
man/woman out of them is not a profession. Why shouldn't child be cared
for by husband. Family is perverse. Be single and spend more in
economy.*" Destruction of an institute life Family is quite easy but
these guys never give an alternative. What can replace a family? And can
we survive without family? When market and media go hand in hand,
disaster follows. And they have been remarkably successful in that
aspect.\

\

Woman, especially girls, love to consider themselves an expert about
boys. I found it amusing that despite of this colossal confidence in
their abilities they mostly end up with a guys whom they think they have
been avoiding all of their life - and they repeat this many times.
Girls, do make judgement quite early about boys. In 2-3 minutes they
will preoccupy themselves with some idea of them and then there is no
power in this world which will make them change their mind. It also
happens at home. Arguing with a female is never been a good idea, and
will never be. They somehow can not believe that in the matter of
emotions and relations, a male can think more rationally than
themselves. No doubt they mature early but I have no iota of doubts that
they grow wise prematurely. It is better if you understand this and
never argue with the girl you really want to spend your life with. There
is not hope dude. If you really love arguing, stay single or become a
gay.

END NOTES :

\

Despite of limited resources, security and opportunity available, Indian
rural woman are infinitely stronger than their urban counterpart. Though
they shows a quite a week nature while they are girls, but when married
they do whatever they could to take over their new home. The battles
which ensues between the newly wed would-be-owner and the current owner
which is her Mother-in-law always visible and make a significant portion
of rural stories of the day. Though, most of the rural families faces a
decline in these battles, but a few good things come out of it. A larger
voice of the mother always guarantee a better future for her children.
Rural males, however find themselves at the mercy of females of their
homes. I have never seen any man in my village trying to shut-up the
women of his home. They generally leave the home and come back when the
storm is over. Well, this is not the case in every caste. Women become
more stronger as the status of cast declines. In higher castes - take
for example Chauhans - women generally do not go out of their homes
(even if you insist, they will not) but the power within the house they
enjoy are immense. Home  and finance ministry are in their hands, labor
ministry is given to the male members. Outside the house, however, its
the male member who is all-mighty but all of them know who is the real
king inside the house. Even if some financial deal is made between them
outside the home, others will ask this guy, go ask your children if deal
is fine. By children they mean, go ask your wife if she likes it.
Nothing happens in a Chauhan family without their approval. Among Jats
also, woman enjoys quite a power - but not in all of them. Some castes
are very oppressive towards women. 

\
Rinki Bhattachararya, in her recently-released book **Behind Closed
Doors: Domestic Violence in India**(Sage, 2004) has narrated first
person accounts by women of different communities and classes of their
experiences in encountering violence and verbal abuse within the four
walls of their marital home. Again, some of the most disturbing are
those of women from middle-class "educated" families. I place the word
educated within quotes deliberately. The true meaning of education ought
to be enlightenment, a liberal and generous approach towards other human
beings, and above all humility because the more educated we are the more
we realise how little we know. Unfortunately, the way the word
"educated" is used these days has very little to do with this
definition. It merely means an accumulation of paper degrees and
qualifications. It has very little to do with the world-view you
develop, the way learning changes your approach to life.\

Kalpana is quite sympathetic to fellow woman and hence hesistate to
write about unpleasant things about woman. A lot of misery which urban
woman put themselves into are their own deed. They seem to have much
more freedom to choose their life partner than they can afford. Somehow
most of them ended up with someone they always claim to avoid. I have
never been a big fan of their judgmental capabilities about men.
