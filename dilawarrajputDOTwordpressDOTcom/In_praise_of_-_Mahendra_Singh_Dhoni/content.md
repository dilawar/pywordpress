Students of psychology and history will have to tell us why M.S. Dhoni
is not considered the greatest of Indian cricketers while many others
with much less to show for themselves are considered worthy of this
title by many? I agree that comparison between generation can be
misleading but comparison between achievements should not be. If he is
not considered greatest because of a lack of technique or "graceful"
hitting then one wonders about our value system. If one gets his job
done very well despite of having a bad technique, should it matter? Or
should he be considered incredibly creative? In addition to being the
most successful captain, he is one of the finest batsmen (consider the
spot at which he bats), a good wicket-keeper and the most self-reliant
and mentally strong sportsman. How many times have you seen him
compensating his lack of skills by a boyish display of aggression?

Moreover he belongs to a sub-species among Indians who rose to the top
with little or no help from anyone else. Anyone who is from a
disadvantageous background has to be more than average to do the
average. And he had accomplished some great things, he must be the
greatest.

Credit is due to Mr. P.C. Podar and Raju Mukherjee who noticed and
recommended him for U19 team. A special thanks to Mr. Dilip Vengsarkar
who has a long a glorious history of nurturing cricket in India for
selecting him. It is always a joy watching him on the ground play and
lead.
