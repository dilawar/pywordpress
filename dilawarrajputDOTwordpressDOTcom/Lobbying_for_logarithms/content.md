The trouble with spending time on a 'good university' (or having
educated parents) is that it might make you incapable of thinking about
certain ideas. If you are a historian trained in Harvard University,
than like New York Times, you may not be able to think beyond the
nations of Atlantis. An economist, who have spend a fair amount of
his/her time in 'Chicago-Stockholm Express' can not digest the criticism
of 'free-market'. A typical students of Jawaharlal National University
find it hard to listen to what neoliberals has to say. Indian
journalists trained in Western privy league universities can not believe
that poor do exists in India e.g. according to Times of India, we are
living in a golden age. A typical engineer or scientist can not believe
that there could be some soocial problems which can not solved by
implementing some sort of technology. Fortunately, on the campus of IITB
(or on any campuses which takes pride in producing 'Whiz Kids' rather
than Bose of Raman) we do not have these kind of problems. Actually no
one can accuse us of having any radical idea. Outside India, engineers
have shown tremendous diversity of thoughts. From Ludwig Wittgenstein to
Osama Bin Laden, we have touched upon many facets of ideas. Indeed,
seeking a career in tangentially related fields have now become a norm
rather than an exception on most of the engineering campuses in India. I
have more to say about it, see [Appendix]\
\
It not just universities which can blind us. We loose many faculties as
we move ahead in our school education system. Here, I am going to
reflect on logarithms (in fact, going to lobby for them) and their
superiority over linear scales generally used in academia. In passing
we'll touch upon many seeming unrelated ideas. Our central argument is
going to be based on evolution. And social construct which might have
played their roles building up our predilection for a liner scale at the
cost of logarithms.\
\
Necessity is NOT a mother of all inventions? Though necessity is mother
of most of the inventions in Industrial age. Most of the early
inventions might have been done out of curiosity only. Their necessity
only became apparent later e.g. cooking food on fire was not a
necessity, some chap might have got curious about it. But invention of
scales might have been a necessity. Comparison is what we do when we
start seeing. To compare we need a scale. Early humans might have liked
to compare few things for sure. Size of their potential hunt and meat it
can provide them. Size of their social group and of adversaries etc.
Comparing is an old habit. Nothing has changed in this regard. In modern
times, on schools or on any universities, we are always compared.
Although the methods are changed. First we were compared whether we are
born in a certain class or caste, now we are compared, along with these
primitive social construct, how well we perform in certain competitions
and how much we earn. Linear scales are mostly employed. Lets consider
something we are all concerned about, marks! On a linear scale, anyone
who scored 70 in one test and 100 in the next has a growth of 30;
another who improved from 20 to 50 also has a growth of 30. Should both
progress be termed as 'same'? On a linear scale, yes! Perhaps the the
range of the marks is not quite large in which we can produce a visible
contrast. Besides linear scales become more relevant when we compare
seemingly 'same' entities. A class can be compared on a linear scale but
a high-school student and a graduate student surely can not. How about
when we have to compare different entities? I can run half a kilometer
and and take Mr. X who can run 10 kilometer in one stretch. If somehow I
am able to run 4 kilometer; will my willpower is 'same' as Mr. X should
he run 14 kilometers. If yes, then this is unfair! My improvement by a
factor of '4' make Mr. X run 10x4 = 40 kilometer to claim the same level
of 'willpower'. What about frequency response of two amplifiers? Would
you measure it in linear scale and then compare? Or pH of two solutions,
magnitude of two earthquakes, level of two sounds. Then question arises
which scale is more natural. Linear of Logarithm?\

\
\
It is quite astonishing to note that how frequently we encounter
logarithms (also pi) in natural phenomenons. One wonders where our
presupposition with linear scale is misguided. Whether it is an equation
representing diode characteristics, sum of an infinite series, frequency
response of an amplifier, no of animals in animal kingdom (save humans)
at various level of food chain, distribution or errors, definite pattern
in seemingly chaos, transmission of energy in food chain, distribution
of prime numbers ([Prime Number
Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem)), no of
applicants universities can accommodate (10% for others, 1% for IIT's),
distribution of most search keywords on the Internet
http://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/universality.pdfSee (or on
IITB DC, you can get the data using tcpdump utility); topic of most
shared article on Times of
India[](http://www.blogger.com/footnode.html#foot12) [2] website, pH of
solutions, strength of an earthquake, level of sound, decline in
interest in reading and writing (and possibly in thinking also),
distribution of letters in a write-up, frequency of location of wars,
neural response to pain etc. If logarithmic scale is really so natural
then why we have come to be possessed by linear scale?\
\

There is very little evidence to pass a judgment on this. Written
evidence, firstly very few exists, does not say very concrete about
these tendencies. However there are certain patterns which give some
idea about existence of some logarithmic scales in ancient
civilizations. Take for example, in old Chinese and Egypt number system
they have used power of 10 [3]
[](http://www.blogger.com/footnode.html#foot13)to represent their
numbers. Oldest language of this world, language of Indus valley [4],
[](http://www.blogger.com/footnode.html#foot14)is still an enigma and
has not been decrypted. It contains in itself a treasure trove about
early human civilization.\
\
\
\
\
\
Before we use evolution to justify our stand, we have to say something
about evolution. In fact evolution deserve a separate note. Its has been
a major force in last century. Few ideas have influenced humanity in
such a great extent. Evolution has been used and misused [5]
[](http://www.blogger.com/footnode.html#foot47)by many. Recently many
weakness of evolution has been confirmed. It is not able to explain
everything. It does not explain why chicks of a hen who was put under
stressful condition are also stressful and shows a tremendous decline in
their learning capabilities. This disability continued in their
successive generation even if their children were raised under normal
condition. A small stretch of distress of mother can make her offspring
capabilities limited. Take Sweden for example. Sweden used to have a
pattern in which after every 20 years there was a severe lack of food.
People born in these times have shown life expectancy well below from
those who were born in normal times. Evolution has no clue about it. You
may be in IIT not because it is in your genes but because your
grandfather ate well or your grandmother of your great grandfather had a
happy life. Indeed, there is a high correlation between your social
standing and your achievements [Bet83] . On top of it, it is a truism
that a person born in socially backward family cannot achieve the same
level of success despite of having same level of natural abilities. It
is quite visible among the backwards and socially deprived cast group.
The stigma and inhumane practice of discrimination can make low of their
self esteem. Anyone who is born in high social group but in a poor
family only has to strive for resources. For example, the great Indian
cricketer Palwankar Baloo (eldest and most talented among the four
Palwanker brothers who were supremely gifted cricketer) had to go
through in their career [Guh]. Evolution does not give any credible
explanation how culture and social practices will influence an
individual or a society in next 100 years.

\
\
\
Evolution is quite successful in explaining behaviors which have
'evolved' due to 'necessity' and 'interests' over a long period of time.
For example take the universal phenomenon of choosing mating partners
(or life partners). Robert Trivers [rob72] believes that among the
mammals a 'sex with the greater minimal investment in offspring is
selected to be more choosy; the sex with the lesser investment is
selected to be more promiscuous and competitive.' 'In the human
species', argues Steven Pinker, author of Blank Slate, 'our mammalian
physiology makes women the greater-investing sex', though the fact that
our males also invest in their offspring 'blunts the asymmetry, and
makes both sexes compete and choose,'. 6.Though using different
criteria: fertility for men choosing women, ability and willingness to
invest for women choosing men. It explains why men 'have liking for
female breasts'. Just due to the fact that it symbolizes how well a
female can feed their offspring should he have one with her. Woman
craving for 'gossips' can also be explained in similar terms
[7](http://www.blogger.com/footnode.html#foot28) . This was the only way
to gather information regarding their potential mates (foes and friends
also). Their tendencies to pick a 'dark hero' (dark dashing outlaws know
as 'clads' in academic circle) for short term affair and 'romantic and
proper hero' (caring and well meaning, known as 'dads') for marriage and
relationships can also be explained. Former can provide better genes
while the later can provide nurture and a stable future to their
offspring. Steven Pinker [Pin07], author of the Blank Slate has more to
say on it. He has also tried to figure out why humanity crave for
fiction; but be advised, he is not admired in certain academic circle
for really [good reasons](http://www.slate.com/id/2271666/) [you] .\
\
\
Now we have argued more than enough in defense of the suitability of
'evolution' to study language and numbers evolution. If this is right
than babies, children and uneducated (or unaffected) adults should show
a liking towards logarithmic scale. In fact, if you try to teach
children in nearby primary school, they seem to follow linear scale up
to few tens. They can give some examples if you ask them. When you
insist to use abstraction e.g. ask them to use their hands to represent
quantities by stretching them away from each other; they do not follow
linear scale. Its not only the kids in Primary School Nichalpur who do
that. Few months back a study has also confirmed it [AS10]. Apparently
children in the West also tend to do the same.But adults instead use a
linear scaling, in which the distance between each number is the same
irrespective of their magnitude. Philip Ball, a consultant editor with
Nature, reviewed this study. 'This could be because adults are taught
that is how numbers are 'really' distributed, or it could be that some
intrinsic aspect of brain development creates a greater predisposition
to linear scaling as we mature. To distinguish between these
possibilities', Seigler and his colleagues 'tested an adult population
that was 'uncontaminated' by schooling'. 'The implication of their
finding', they say, is that "the concept of a linear number line seems
to be a cultural invention that fails to develop in the absence of
formal education". [AS10]\
\
\
\
\
\
Numbers and languages8 are deeply related. One can locate same parallels
there also. Untouched tribal cultures of Amazon have surprised us many
times.9 It was surprising enough for anthropologists to learn that there
exists a tribal language called
http://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/piraha/803Piraha in which natural
numbers are totally absent. For them it was inconceivable to think a
language without having natural numbers in it. They have sounds of one,
few and many which they encode by souds of 'hoi', 'hoye', 'hoyeeeiiii'
[Gor04]. Indeed, their hoi's have an indication of thinking in
logarithmic scale. For them 105 is more akin to 100, while 1 and 6
surely are different. Another well studied tribal language is of
[Mundurucus](http://www2.cnrs.fr/en/319.htm?debut=16&theme1=8) which
does not have any exposure to linear counting scale of the
industrialized world, just magnitude on log scale. 10\
\
\
One could argue that real quantities are linear. 1 kilometer is a
kilometer whether you have traveled 1 km or 100 km. Well yes and no, as
Philip Ball has written, 'Many creatures, execute random walks or the
curious punctuated random walks called Levy flights, in which migrations
over a fixed increment in distance takes an ever longer time. Besides,
we can usually assume that an animal capable of covering 100 kilometres
could manage 101, but not necessarily that one capable of 1 kilometre
could manage 2 kilometres (try the latter case with a young child).'\

Appendix :\
The doyen of Indian anthropologist M. N. Srinivas has reflected on this
phenomemon many times. See  [Sri96]. About educated parents who 'do not
pay any attention to the talents and inclinations of their children in
choosing careers' and force them to pick up engineering and medicine so
that they can boost 'their image in thier own social circle', he notices
'A surer and more expensive way of producing misfits can not imagined
and the country has been doing this for over 50 years'. Talink of
professional edcation and IIT does not figure is not possible. He
continues, 'The IITs enjoy great prestige as Institutions and they are
highly subsidised by the government. Admission to them is eagerly sought
after and highly competetive, but how many of those who graduate from
them stay in India? Indeed, the question need be asked, how many of
those who benefit from studying in the elite institutes of higher
education in India seek careers in the county? Our most successful
exports are our best and brightest men and women'. Since 90's, though
the situation has improved a lot still what he had poited out about the
U-turn Indian media took in 90's on the question of brain-drain is still
relevent, 'Until recently, some concern was expressed about the
\`\`brain drain'' from India to the developed countries, and need to
\`\`reverse'' the flow. But such concerns seem to have evaporated
quietly, and the expatriat have become NRIs, whose dollars are more
important to the country than their skills, qualification and
expericance. The irony of this situation seems to be lost on everyone.
Greenbacks are preferred to grey cells' .\
