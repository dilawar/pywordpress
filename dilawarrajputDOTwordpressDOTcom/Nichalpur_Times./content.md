There is a very jubilant mood among 'ghar ki murgis' in Nichalpur.
Because their beloved equation of their well-being '*ghar ki murgi daal
barabar'*is showing wonderful numbers after the skyrocketing price rise
in *daal.* You might be aware that this equation fetched a *'kukduku
prize'*for *Ramlaal MurgaÂ *who was an economist. This prize is given by
'Gangaram Academy of Science' and 'Ramlaal' was the only Murga ever to
win it.\
\
However, there were some voices of concerns who were asking why some of
'ghar ki murgis' vanished and their remains found on the backyard, just
like of Ramlaal. Some people are saying that that is an act of
committing suicide since some Murgis can not stand the mental pressure
or rising economy. Some are saying that they have committed suicide
because they were consuming liquors. Some even believes that is work of
"Chicxals' who believes that some humans eats because they can no longer
afford 'daal'. They are fightening for 'Ghar ki Murgi' emancipation from
a threat unknown. They might have killed them.\
\
There were celebration all the night. There was some MOU signed between
them and a FAT CAT who visit this village sometimes. The details of the
MOU has not been made 'public'.
