Civil Society is not a new idea - if we consider that voluntary actions
and individual initiative are at heart of it - its presence in India is
rather new. Fifty years ago, except for Marxist who drew inspiration of
Gramsci rather than Lenin, we did not hear much talk about civil
society. These days, civil society has taken the center-stage. People
from a very ill defined category of public intellectuals are writing
articles on it but it is not at all convincing that they are talking
about the same thing. It is far from my intention to belittle the
discussions on how effective a civil society can be towards making
individual and collective life more fruitful, but when people do not
have a clear idea of civil society and its composition, it will be a
mistake to believe that one can reach very far in understanding their
capabilities and their roles.\
\
In earlier days, public intellectuals were fond of the state which they
thought was undoubtedly a powerful and secular force in a largely
undemocratic and backward society and if applied effectively and boldly,
would change it. [Today the state has lost its
sheen.](http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?270136) Part of reason
to this disenchantment lay in the high expectation from the state and
belief in its trans-formative powers. Its actual performance was
indifferent, and Emergency and aftermath showed that it could be
oppressive and ineffectual. The multiple scams of unimaginable magnitude
has only strengthened these feelings. Among the youths, these feelings
have taken rebellious colors. They seem to be much more interested in
getting 'things' done even if it takes bypassing and weakening the
democratic institutes. These indifferent attacks on the foundation of
democracy are expected from a society which has been and still a largely
hierarchical society.\
\
The romance with civil society is not because of itself. It is an
outcome of growing mistrust in political parties, the legislature, snail
paced judiciaries and bureaucracy.\
\
Individual initiatives and voluntary actions are vital for a democracy
to grow. If by civil societies are able to provide platform to these
activities then their importance can not be over emphasized. One can
blame state for dampening the spirit of entrepreneurship and voluntary
action in early decades of independence but it only reinforced and did
not create these habits of mind already present in a caste- and
kin-based hierarchical society. \
\
Alexis de Tocqueville was the first political theorist who dwell on
significance and importance of voluntary- action and associations for a
democracy. Let me quote his often quoted words,\

> Whenever at the head of new undertaking you see the government in
> France, or a man of rank in England, in United States you will be sure
> to find an association.

Â He believed that Americans have the special knack for creating and
sustaining association which French lacked, and that is one reason why
democracy was more successful in America than in France. Can same be
said about India?\
\
In India, the proliferation of NGO's gives an impression that we Indian
also do have a knack for creating associations. But going by numbers
only could be misleading such as we also have largest number of
universities but that does not make us world leader in education. We
should know little bit more about how they are started, operated,
organized and supported. And most importantly, being an institute, we
should also know by what means they seek to ensure their continuity.\
\
What is interesting and puzzling about Indian NGO's that they are mostly
started by some government functionaries of the state. They are able to
provide their NGO's valuable financial contacts and legal and
administrative expertise. There is no wonder that some NGO's run with
flexibility and efficiency one can not expect from from a Byzantine
government bureaucracy.\
\
Any NGO's - a well run association - can not become an institute like
civil society unless it ensures its longevity. The lifespan of an
institute is expected to extend the life span of its members. Its too
early to say how effectively these NGO's will work in near future when
the man who started them will be expired. It is usually the case in
India that family and kin-ship become implicated in the functioning of
an voluntary action. In an increasing number of cases, the wife, the
son, the daughter-in-laws takes over the running of an NGO started by a
man of vision and energy. Indian Administrative Services, despite of
their all shortcomings, has at least managed to ensure recruitment,
promotion and retirement without bringing family into pictures. The
Congress party is one of the epitome of a political family business.
What is worth asking is what model these NGO's will follow? An NGO that
becomes a family business can not contribute much to the building of a
civil society. Although, they have been quite successful in many fronts
where government has failed and deserve public support and sympathy.\

and associations can read works of Andre Beteille and Tocquivelle.\
