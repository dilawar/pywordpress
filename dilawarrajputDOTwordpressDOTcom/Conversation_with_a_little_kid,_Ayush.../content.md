Yesterday while watching CN at my Paying Guest residence, two kids came
there bubbling around.. One was a boy and other was a girl. They were
happy that I was watching CN. When their mummy came, he said, "Mummy, ye
bhaiya bhi cartoon dekhte hai.." with a wide smile on his face. Later
they went to shopping and Ayush that kid stayed with me.\
\
I taught him how to tie show-laces which he found very easy. Then I made
him a paper camera which is by the way very famous :-) ... He was happy
with that.Then a bird and elephant and donkey uising papers. When I was
making them, He asked, "Bhaiya ye doosre bed par kaun sota hai. Aapki
girldriend?" "Hehe, nahi mera roommate. Tumhe lagta hai meri girlfriend
yaha soti hogi.".\
"Aapki girlfriend hai naa?"\
"Hmmm,, lets say no! Tumhari hai"\
"Haan! do hai naa!!"\
"Arrey wah, par ye to gandi baat hai.. ek hi girlfrined honi chaiye."\
\
He smiled and said ,"Theek hai ek ko main chor dunga, use aap rakh
lena."\
Kitna achcha bachcha tha.. I asked, "Kaun si wali"\
"Meri do girlfried hai, Yana aur "some name i forgot" aap Yana ko le
lena."\
"Kyu Yana tumhe pasand nahi hai.."\
"Arrey bhaiya ... pahle to mujhse itna ladti thi naa... mujhe dekhte ki
ladne lagti thi.. main use bolta tha 'Yaana main tera bana dunga
banana!"\
\
"To fir woh tumhari girlfreind kaise bani"\
"lambi kahani hai, aap use rakh lena par woh bahut choti hai!"\
"Koi baat nahi, saath main cartoon dekhne ke kaam aayegi"\
"Haan! par jab main aau to usko bhaga dena fir hum dekhenge, Doremon aur
Dragon-ball Z"\
"Woh Goku bala aur uska beta Gohan"\
"Arrey bhaiya ab to uske bete ka bhi beta ho gaya hai.."\
\
His parents came back after shopping and so I had to say good-night
after giving him and his sister all the paper-folding I had made for
them.\
