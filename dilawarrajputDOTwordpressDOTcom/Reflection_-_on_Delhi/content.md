 When I used to work in NCR (supposedly a part of Delhi), few months
ago, we had many people from Delhi in office - seemingly proud people
from Delhi. Interestingly, none of them was more than 1-2 generation
Delhites. Perhaps this is the only historic city to have such a large
number of ahistoric people. Well, Indians in general are ahistoric. We
don't give a damn to our history. For most of us, history starts from
1857 and ends in 1947. If by any chance your history teacher likes
Gandhi although the chances are very slim, 6 more months are granted. \
\
In *'Last Mughal'*, William Darymple, using the mutiny papers as primary
sources for his research, showed how British killed the identity of
Delhi. The writers, painters, musicians and great family of
*Shahajahananbad* were scattered and in their places merchants and like
people were encouraged to move in.\
\
Since then, people are moving in to make money rather than making a
city. Strangely, people who have no cultural or historical stake in this
city like to be called as Delhites. I don't know the exact reason for
this, perhaps its the glamor attached with the idea of calling oneself
'*creature from the capital*' or may be it is just that influence of
'media matters'.\
\
*Bengalis* came in large numbers when the capital shifted from Calcutta
to Delhi, and later its economic growth brought people from other
States. There is a thriving Tamil community, a growing Telugu community,
a Marathi community and, of course, people from adjoining States –
Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar who
constitutes its most of the work force.\
\
Historically, Western Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab were known for
their 'martial races'. These 'martial races' - [as British used to
classify them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_Race) - are
notorious - as expected - for their feudal behavior. In Indian Armed
Forces, there are more than 50% people from these three states - at
every level.**Given a low level of literacy as well as little exposure
to the other cultures, they tend to behave in not-no-pleasant ways. In
addition, local vernaculars generally sound bad to a person who is new
e.g. *Haryanavi* is perhaps one of the most harsh sounding dialect.
You'll never know if they are fighting with you or talking with you.\
\
Lets leave the working class and come to the [so called 'educated class'
which likes to point
fingers](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/Kalpana_Sharma/article611470.ece)
at the working class over every mess created here. In every two or three
days, you can get the news that some people were driven over by some
car. The parking space fights are anyway famous in Delhi. I really can
not understand how Reader Digest got Mumbai as the rudest city on the
planet.\
\
You talk to any girl in Delhi, and she can tell you very easily how many
of them, whether *civilized* white collar or *working class*blue collar,
behave differently. This is perhaps the only place, where you can see
people justifying '*eve-teasing*'. They may go one step further that
woman wears clothes provocatively and being a male, I have no control
over my erection. Besides, they've got Times of India! If you look at
this paper every morning, somehow you'll be convinced that woman are
really objects! \
\
One of the reason why we need people who take pride in their culture is
that these people can be easily controlled. All you have to do to make
them aware that they are hurting it. People tend to protect whatever
form a part of their identity. If culture become a part of your
identity, you do every thing to protect it, just like your husband,
wife, girlfriend, parents, Indianess, political ideology and whatever.
They have to attach with the city not because its a city with glamor,
because its their home. \
\
The point is, as Bhaskar Ghosh makes
[here](http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2621/stories/20091023262110400.htm), 
'*that an essentially Delhi identity or culture, or image, has not
emerged. It does not exist now, and it may well be a century before
something of the kind does. Because, remember, Delhi as a metropolis has
already spilled over into Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, where there are
distinct and not-very-pleasant characteristics that surface even as
bucolic, placid regions are changed to a mass of expressways, flyovers,
slums and mushrooming buildings, all of them compounded by a shortage of
water and power, and hopelessly inadequate sanitation and drainage*'.\
\
I really don't want to talk about not-so-humble public bureaucrats of
this city. By the way, this city does not have the *annealing*effect
which Chennai and Kolkata posses. If  you stay long enough, you might
develop this habit of being angry and irritated. You simply become like
most of them. This city absorbs you. One of my public spirited colleague
at office admitted it with melancholy that very few visitors like
Delhi.  \
\
From the time of the Ghalib, who has famously said, *"Who'd leave the
streets of Delhi to visit other places" *this city suffer for very acute
inwardness, something like New York. Marathi people also have this kind
of habits but they do not suffer from New York syndrome unless Raj
Thackeray start beating the bush around them.\
\
In some sense, that is how a capital must be like, belongs to no one yet
you can find the whole country inside. But a city without a culture of
its own! No wonder it is so susceptible to Westernization. The very
definition of modernity for this city seems to be "*whatever is not
traditional*".\
\
The place where I stayed during my time in Delhi was a retired army
officer home, he used to call it,"*It's a big village, its not a city.*"
Being from a village, this offends me. Villages are too small to have a
culture of their own, but they compensate it with the sense of community
and families.  \
\
Their Chief Minister, Sheila is brave enough to think that she can
change this attitude of people in record time and NGO's and media are
also running the campaign 'Meri Dilli' etc. Simply because those whose
behavior needs changing will never identify themselves with the
obnoxious characteristics one has mentioned. They will think someone
else is “committing nuisance” in public even as they line up to urinate
against the wall of a protected monument.\
