Dr. J. Ballantyne, (Title of the essay he gave to his students

to write in an attempt to improve their Hindi)

> *We do not clearly understand what you European mean by the term

One of the student spoke on behalf of the group.

As late [Ravindra
Kumar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Kumar)used to say,
"*history is futuristic*". You can run away from history as you please
but History always get you. In India, nothing is ever done with : the
"sack" of Somnath temple is avenged, one thousand years later, in the
fetid fields of Bhagalpur and in the allays of Bombay. You want to
understand anything about India, first get her history right.

\

In childhood, they made me believe that Hindi is originated from
Sanskrit, her loyal first daughter. And other languages Bangla, Marathi,
Gujrati etc. are either the younger daughter of Sanskrit or evolved from
Hindi. Well, with all *"Mera Bharat Mahan"* and *"Proudly say
Hindi-Hindu Hindustan"*drilled into my head, believing all this crap was
so easy and lovable. Then you open a page from history and bang, you are
*disillusioned*! History in India is a hot potato. You write something
right, they will come after you. A single line on Shivaji can lead to
vandalism of a library. Write something about Ram and Krishna and you
could be beaten and tortured. History has always been a part of
Indian-nationalism. It has been used by opportunistic middle class.
Perhaps that is why we get All these *Hindiwallah*, who once forced this
crap on us, now boast their children who can not even write and read
their own mother tongue though they still looses their mind if someone
argues why Hindi is a national language? Well, having double standard is
the hallmark of Hindi/Bangla middle class. If *Hindiwallah* have
moralist argument about corruption in the public, they do hobnobbing
with them in private. And if at twenty a Bangali marches with party, by
forty they work in some U.S. university. Over the time, things have
changed. Now they do all of these at the same time. Anyway, We'll try to
restrict ourselves to the matter of Hindi.  The biases of mine should be
made clear. Hindi is quite a passionate matter for me. But neither I use
English as a replacement of Hindi, nor Hindi as an excuse of not
learning English. If English allows me to reach a wider audience (even
though my grammar is mostly wrong), Hindi enables me to put my feelings
in my diary. I'd not mind being emotionally bilingual.[Learning
different languages are always
beneficial.](http://dilawarsays.blogspot.com/2010/09/what-is-there-in-language.html)

\

Perhaps, you might have heard what they say about Hindustan. "हिंदुस्तान
की अजब कहानी, कोस कोस पर बदले पानी, चार कोस पर वाणी." (This is weired
fact about Hindustan, at every mile, the water changes its taste; at
every four mile, language changes its dialect.") Perhaps post-Bollybood
Hindi is way too homogeneous and people grew up in cities may have not
even appreciated/witnessed these nuances. But in villages, these
differences are very vivid. I was surprised to know that just 2
kilometer away from my village, they use the word *buhari* for
*jhaadu*and are unaware of the existence of the other word. Reason is
simple, only women uses this *buhari*and they do not visit my village
since there is no relationships between them. They are Vishnoi
community, mine is Chauhans.

\

What Ballyntyne was insisting was exactly killing these vernacular for
the sake of a single one, just like they have in his mother-land,
Europe. What his student said was more or less the fact that India is a
melting pot of culture, race, and languages and it should evolve at its
own pace. No matter how slowly.

\

But people who proud themselves to be forward looking or modern are
mostly are at pain with this inherent steadiness and slowness. They want
to change the world as rapidly as they please and if people show
reluctance, they call them with all those fancy names, uneducated,
conservative, fundamentalists, yokel, villagers, indecent etc. Society
changes at its own pace, almost slowly. They will pick whatever will
make their life less miserable and adapt. If pajamas were widespread in
my village at my father time than my grandfather's time, it is not due
to the fact of Westernization but simply life is easier with pajams than
with lungi. Just like these days life is easier in t-shirts than in
kurta of shirts. Well, I am not denying the influence if Lakme fashion
week or M.Tv. but their followers are quite small.

\
There is no escape from language. If its speaker changes it slowly, it
changes its speaker, rather strongly. A language always comes with some
characteristics. Bangla always comes with chauvinism with her, Tamil is
full of traditions, Hindi is full of arrogance. Their speakers show
these characteristics almost all the time. You talk with a Tamil in
English, now if another Tamil joins the group there will be no change,
three of them will communicate in English. You talk with a Bengali
person in English, another Bengali joins and bang, both of them will
talk in Bengali and will forget you. Ok, if you make some faces, they
will be polite enough to translate it for you with a look which will
make you feel that you made a mistake. Talk with a Hindi person, in some
other language which is not English, he will somewhat force you to speak
in Hindi. If one more Hindi joins then they probably start invoking the
'*this is national language crap'.* If you talk in English, then no
problem, they are somehow very timid attacking English unless they are
not educated. But they would never mind giving you a lecture why you
should learn Hindi even if He can not read of write a good quality
Hindi.\
\
\
Its not their fault, really. Its the way Hindi was raised by it
guardians. The invention of Hindi was a huge project and was implemented
heroically. But if the child has polio in begining what one can do.\

 This monumental work by Chadradhar Sharma Guleri needs really careful
reading and would probably require at least a B.A. in Hindi to
understand all of it. The evolution goes like this.  Root language -\>
Vedic Language -\> Sanskrit on one hand, and Root Language -\> Vedic
Labguage -\> Prakrat -\> *Apbhransh* on the other hand. Sankrit was the
language of elites that is why it is *ajar-amar.* It was not the
language of the masses, that is why it did not survive. One social
movement and English can be wiped out like Sanskrit since it does not
have huge support, besides those who supports it (either to hold on to
power or otherwise) can not stand the tide since it comes with a guilty
conscience of not honoring  their mother tongue. They can be defeated
easily, the real challenge is to defeat the Hindiwallah first.

\

Vedic language had two stream. One kept flowing, the Prakrit. Other's
flow was stopped in Sanskrit by a huge dam - Panini's grammar. The
changes were to occur only in Pratik. Sanskrit was standardized (the
perfect one, language of gods) and left there as a sacred stone, only to
worship. The changes can be observed in Pratrik. For example, in vedic
language we have both देवा: and देवास: in Sanskrit only देवा:  left. In
Prakrat आसस turned into आओ. देवे: is replaced to देवेभि: in Prakrat
(easy to worship) but Sankrit is devoid of this freedom. अस्मिन changed
into ममी to म्म्ही and ultimately into में of Hindi. 

\

The Vedic language, Asoka's language of his pillars disseminating
knowledge of Buddhism, The writings of Buddhist monk in Pali, Jain's
Magadhi, Gadbad Sanskrit, Kharosti are all old samples which say the
tale of this remarkable flow. New dialects were formed by intercourses
of these languages. Then there was politics. Politics of language is not
new. If Sanskrit was being termed as language of gods, Magadhi people
were claiming that their language is the root language which the first
men and gods spoke.

\
There were so many languages, the promiscuity of their intercourse leads
to the mother of Hindi - *Apbhransh*- which one can safely termed
*Purani Hindi.* The time was 7th century A.D. to 11'th century A.D..
Drawing an exact line is impossible. People believe that first poetry
work in any sort of *Hindi*was *Chandravar Dai's Prithiviraj Raso*in
praise of the heroic of *Prathviraj Chauhan (and thus being a Chauhan
makes me part of this heritage).***I should write a different blog for
Purani Hindi. There are lot of issues at stake here. For example, if
Hindi is evolved form Sanskrit only then how come Hindi is so gender
sensitive (*jata hai, jati hai, khata hai, khati hai*)? Sanskrit is not,
and the most Sanskratised modern Indian language of Bangla is also not
gender sensitive. Why this happened to Hindi? Take the word  पुरुष
(purush - man), in Vedic language it meant both man and woman. पुरुषार्थ
meant finding the meaning of being a male as well as of being a female.
Why Panini (the Brahmin) made it so that it can only be used in
masculine way? Oh! These Brahmins, they only knew how to pollute things
they touched or how to make people untouchables. We should have been
more careful. We'll talk about it some other time, lets jump to the 18th
century where a section of middle class calling themselves
*Hindiwallah*were finding some sort of identities in a melting pot of
languages which they loved to call Hindi.

They called it Hindi* *

 "*When people say Hindi is not a language, I feel a lot of pain*", was
the words of a remarkable man, Bhartendu Harishchandra. He was to Hindi
what Ramanujan was to Number theory. Ramanujan died young, Bhartendu
younger. He was 36 when he died yet he left behind a legacy which is now
termed as '*Bhartendu yuga*' of Hindi literature. What Bhartendu sought
was an idea of a title for Hindi (Khari boli). He was well aware of the
inconsistency of his claim. Which is reflected in his writing, he only
wrote prose in Khari boli, his poetry was in different dialect *Braj
Bhasha* - the most prominent dialect of Hindi that time.  \
\
When one wants to fight for an idea, one has to give it a name. A simple
name so that he need not to explain it again and again, so that its
meaning can be changed later for one's benefit, so that people forget
what this word was all about in the beginning, so that you can invoke
passion and chauvinism just by mentioning a single word. That what they
did with Hindi. Once the word takes the first seats, the idea behind it
just its meaning. "*Meaning is, in some sense,*", As Alok Rai says, "*a
conspiracy: one which both includes and excludes, conspiracy with,
conspiracy against."* Watching a program in Doorhandles in my childhood,
I was awestruck by the fluency of a Pakistani group of Hindi, though
they were speaking Urdu, in the same way, north Indians are frequently
disconcerted at being complimented by Pakistanis on their fluency of
Urdu, Pakistan's national language . Because they thinks that they are
using Hindi, India's national language. One man Hindi could be another
man's Urdu and vice versa.\
\
Though from linguistics point of view, it'd  hardly matter what you call
it, but this matter of naming - as far as I can see - may still hold
sway over people. They might be willing to kill or die for name.\
\
Kill Braj Bhasa, she is too old\

> *Braj literature is the very life's breath of Hindi... Without a deep
> study of Braj Bhasha, it is impossible to know Hindi fully. Therefore
> Braj Bhasha is even today not something that belongs to the past, but
> in essential to Bharat's dynamic and hopeful future.*

Seth Govind Das, April 4, 1952 (Translation Alok Rai), ibid pp91

> *Braj Bhasha is used mainly by illiterate rustic, but Khari Hindi is
> used by well-educated both for speaking and writing.*

I always like to say that India is a land of ironies and paradoxes.
Though these paradoxes never attract debated as they should, they are
very easy to find in documented history. When Ayodhya Prasad Khatri
published his book *Khari Boli ka Padya* at his own expense, he made a
point that Khari Boli is capable of great poetry and poetry is not the
prerogative of *Braj Bhasa* only. At this time the great Bhartendu was
using Khari boli of prose only, he felt some sort of uncouthness in
Khari boli for doing poetry. Khatri's claim was ridiculed by almost all
those who later became Hindiwallah and conspire to do the Braj Bhasa in.
Braj had its strongest tradition in *riti kavya,* its obsession with
female body parts. Few used to scorn at it, but comparing Braj with
Khari Boli was like saying something bad about Thackeray in front of
Shiv Sena.\
\
People did not have any problem with Khari boli in prose. It was capable
of serious arguments as Bhartendu Harishchandra had shown in his work.
But the time for Khari Boli was ripe, Braj had to go. It survived among
in the masses in the poetry of devotion. But its *riti kavya (*comparing
everything with women parts) did not find places among average
household. Most of them considered it obscene. The defense of Braj was
not at all possible.\
\
Khatri, distinguished five styles of Khari Boli Hindi, authentic Hindi
(thet Hindi) -- was represented by Insahallah Khan's "*Rani Ketki ki
kahani" (first story of modern Hindi)*, the second, *Euresia,*was marked
by an apparently farcical admixture English word (Today, known as
*Hinglish -*championed by [Times of
Idiots](http://dilawarsays.blogspot.com/2010/10/times-of-idiots.html) *)*;
Pandit style, heavily laden with Sanskrit; Maulvi Style, persianised;
The style of masses, Munshi style. The pundit style was championed by
*Mahavir Prasad Dwedi*, Munshi Style was used by Premchand and co. These
days the most prominent is Euresian style or Hinglish in urbane North
India.\
\
The argument made by sensitive and sophisticated observer Bhartendu in
front of [Hunter
commission](http://www.banglapedia.org/httpdocs/HT/H_0194.HTM) that
Khari Boli is too stiff and too prosaic to do any poetry was right. It
took three generation of [heroic
innovators](http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/~bhatele/hindi/devel.htm) --

.. -- to make Khari Boli sound like a poetry rather than a vedic
ritual.\
\
It is notable that in 1911, at Nagari Pracharini Sabha, Khari Boli was
hailed by those who had been on the side of the Braj at the time of
Khatri controversy. The inevitability of Khari boli's triumph was
captured by an anonymous bard in these two lines, an interesting variant
of modern railway metaphor,\

> देख रेल का सिग्नल तुम किस कारन झुक जाते हो. संसारी जीवो को इससे क्या
> तुम कुछ सिखलाते हो? (Seeing the oncoming train, O signal, why do you
> promptly go down? Do you seek thus to teach us worldly folk some
> lesson?)

Ultimately, they did her in. The argument was simple, she has become an
old lady has unbecoming obsession for ornaments (her *riti
Kavya* traditions).\

 Braj is dead, Now get Urdu\

  In 1900, at the inaugration of what is universally\
  known as the Hindu Hostel of University of\
  Allahabad was raised by Madan Mohan Malviya .\
  MacDonnel was the guest of honour because a short\
  while ago he initiated the most fateful decision in the\
  history of Hindi - the use of Devanagri Script in the\
  court of province. He has now faded from the memory of\
  Modern Hindi - as expected in India. The plaque the\
  commemorate this incident is lay hidden behind the weeds.\
  And the hostel is named after Malviya.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The argument that Urdu was killed only by Hindiwallah is wide of the
mark. The contribution of Urduwallah was immense. They helped a lot in
killing Urdu, mostly unknowingly. Urdu, in 19th century, used be as
prominent as English is today.\
