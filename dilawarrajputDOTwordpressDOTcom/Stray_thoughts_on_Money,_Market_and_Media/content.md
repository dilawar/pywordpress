Arguably the boldest journalist of our time, P. Sainath is of the view
that if you replace '**editor as corporate owner**' then **'Mark Twain’s
words retain their freshness and meaning after more than 125 years.'**
Also, **'they are astonishingly prescient.'** Another line in the same
passage of Twain’s ‘Lionizing Murderers’ goes on to say, **‘Worse things
are in store for you. You will be sent to Congress.’**Now who can deny
the truism of these words!\
\
Hugh Culdip, legendary editor of Guardian newspaper, who wrote many
books, probably never wrote about business models. He probably never
needed one. These days, editors ask this question first, “What should be
our business model?”\
\
I'd like to avoid the charge of making invidious remarks about market. I
have always believed that 'markets' are essential for wealth generation
and business activities. Their importance is due to the fact that there
are no other options available which can replace markets. However,
markets do need adult supervision as recent upheaval have proved. In
many ways, it is like having corrupt policemen in a police-station
rather than having none at all. And policemen too need supervision of an
apt authority. If you leave them loose, well you-know-what-will-happen.
If there is no policeman of whatever quality, I am tempted to believe
that you will not see the pretty face of human nature. No fear of
accountability for policeman is less lethal for society as no fear of
punishment for public. Most people abide by laws not because it pleases
them, but due to the fact that the cost may be high if they do not.
Ultimately we all are from same social pool. Besides, human nature is a
puzzling entity as an old Chinese poem says,\

> When I carefully consider the curious habits of dogs, 

> I am compelled to conclude that man is the superior animal, 

> When I consider the curious habits of man, 

> I confess my friend, I am puzzled. 

\
Curious habits of man? Does this old Chinese mean greed by that? Greed
is not a simple phenomenon to study. Any activity which originates due
to some sort of greed can easily be sustained and - for better - can be
controlled in Markets. Greed in itself is a puzzling question. There are
few faces of greed which are considered good while most of others are
considered bad. If I am greedy for knowledge, I will find much more
admirer than someone who is greedy for money. Someone who is greedy for
money have an advantage over someone who is greedy for someone else
wife. Well, public response seems natural. Since my greed for knowledge
can not harm anyone but me, it is compensated by people admiration.
Greed for money depends on whose money. Till banks, WTO and GATT were
looting Africa and Asia and other developing nations, 'greed were good'
on Wall Street and supported by same public which is now unsparing in
their criticism of greed of their executives. 'Whose resources' is the
question people ask these days. Well, someone's greed for someone else
wife can only be felt by the 'chosen one'. Others may hate him out of a
sense of morality. Because if they chose to praise him then they are
undermining the very social thread by which, they believe, their society
holds together or of which they are proud of.\
\
In passing, I'd like to point out to a class of algorithm in computer
science. Greedy algorithm. Like most of the Indians, greedy algorithm
pick the best option from available choices. There are many situation in
which they work well and produce optimal solutions. If one chose to
study them closely, one can point out when these 'greedy strategies' are
beneficial. If the underlying situation satisfies a property which in
mathematics 'matroid' satisfies, going 'greedy' is optimal. Roughly, in
a situation, when you are sure of that yours or others future will not
be wrongly affected by the choice you making in present, ('independence'
in matroids, roughly); then it is wonderful to be as greedy as possible.
Greedy algorithm is also fast. Since one have already proved (or
believed) that situation is ideal for being greedy, one does not have to
spend time in keeping track of past actions. But alas, a man's future is
never independent of his present. In fact, every present was once a
future. Hence, it follows that 'greedy algorithms' or greedy people for
that matter are short sighted. However, it does not mean that 'greedy
people' will only harm themselves. When other people future is also
dependent on their present actions then there are many of those who
stands to loose for no fault of theirs. The only fault of theirs could
have been that they did not ask questions. Corruption is essentially
what arises from this form of greed.\
\
If market acts like a place for (wealth?) creation and (resource?)
distribution then one have more reasons to be happy than being worried.
But lately, markets have been acting like a place for wealth
displacements. Consider the ubiquitous and rather ridiculous argument in
favour of globalisation was given then by economists that this will
generate the jobs. Ultimately they ended up losing their jobs to India
and China. So to create few fat pockets in their own economy, they have
ruined those who were in need of jobs. It is hard to believe that this
'race to bottom' in which these corporates cut cost (just to give 400%
raise to their executives) by cutting down the jobs in their own
motherland or by outsourcing them to low-cost nations was so popular
among those people who were in charge to do the opposite - or at least
to save the jobs which were already there.\
\
People are now asking why these people got away with all of this?
Perhaps it is imperative to ask why these people behaved in these ways.
I think I do have a partial answers. Anyone who is in acquaintance with
rural India, finds himself at surprise by noticing that these people do
vote for those people who are corrupt and eat their share. Why do they
do that? I have noticed that they do admire them and their urge for
'wealth accumulation'. I do believe that people do not see anything bad
in those whom they strive to become. For example, I may laugh off at Von
Neuman's tendency of ogling over women legs as a small issue but for a
feminist its a serious issue of 'harassment' . Same way, if I am a
marketing student then I can laugh off what *Times of India* daily
publishes, since its marketing strategies are achieving the 'ultimate
aim' of attracting eyeballs. I can laugh off 'ecological damage' in
support of mining if someone have already convinced me that this is
'development'. I can laugh off Arundhati Roy and probably call her a
bitch too. I can laugh off Sainath reporting since he talks about poor
people and in my world they do not exists. So if my bread and butter
lies in Dalal Street, I will surely ignore the rot there.\
\
Public opinion is a very strong shield, and also a sharp sword. These
days its the collective public opinion which make and pull down
governments - at least in functioning democracies. There is no better
way to influence public than using power languages generally provides.
Then the question arises whether the future of languages which are not
well developed for politics is bleak. Khari boli Hindi (a prosaic
language) supplanted Braj Bhasa (a language of poetry) in those
political times when Hindi was being made a prominent language in
colonial India. English, with its grip over elite Indians and
its compatibly with information technology, is slowly replacing (or
already replaced?) regional languages. If regional languages are to be
saved, they can only be saved by either a social movement against
English ( a bad option ) or by making technology available in them.
Media and languages are as related as journalists (or stenographers) and
newspapers. Now the fight for public opinion can only be fought through
media. With such potential, no wonder, journalism these days, is an
lucrative profession.\
\
Throughout human history, it is the fight for resources which never
ended. Though, these days, mostly, wars are replaced by diplomacy and
tactics. Murder and slavery once is now replaced by displacements and
ensued poverty and misery. An improvement I must admit. Now for
'diplomacy' (or lobbying) one needs agents with influences. Greedy
journalists (i.e. short sighted) such as Barkha Dutt and co. tempted to
be a part of it and misguide the public and loose the most valuable
thing a journalists can ever dream of, credibility.\
\
Talking of markets. Men were equal in start of civilization. Then there
was agriculture, and suddenly some of them became more equal. Later,
there was Industrialization and few became much equal. Then there was
'market' in which 'greed was good'! And whoever was not on this
'equality list' found himself on Forbes lists. Its a curious irony that
in advertisements celebration of individualities is mostly done by those
corporations who puts a very high premium of professionalism.
Isn't professionalism anti-individual? \
\
The celebration of Forbes list and similar others go quite well with the
rising 'individuality' in human civilization. The role model for various
countries obsessed with 'macho dream' of prosperity is United States
which celebrates individuality and individual achievements. Most of the
sports they play celebrate individuals rather than teams e.g. golf,
tennis, F-1, boxing etc. Though in basketball there is team, but if club
ABC has won then it is sure that Mr. XYZ must have scored 30. Still,
contrary to the  desires of hard-core Socialists, resilience of American
society have been astonishing. Habits of United States are important to
look out for, especially for my country where a lot of ideas and
theories are being imported without any assessment or calibration for
native conditions. After the non-traditional middle class of India which
have always celebrated 'wealth-accumulation' - which have supplanted a
traditional one which was a Calvinistic halo -  have captured Indian
imagination, this habit is only going to be strong - at least in this
century. Americans have shown tremendous philanthropy as well as
participation in their local government. In India, this have
been embarrassingly low. At best, Indians accumulates for family. Well
being of society is a choice few will consider in their 'to-do' list. In
passing, I would emphasize the question whether 'obsession with family'
at the cost of 'society' can sustain the nation?\
\
Markets, by their nature, are not suitable for family. Since they
promotes competitiveness and 'nepotism' tends to ignore it, I am tempted
to pass a judgment that 'western markets' are not compatible with
Indians unless they are taught well about them or a sense of 'community'
is nurtured among them. There are reports that in U.S., over 70%
of philanthropy are done by individuals. If this is true, then wealth
generated by individual is surely good for a nation. [But this argument
can not hold true in India where 90% philanthropy is done by
government](http://www.bain.com/bainweb/publications/publications_detail.asp?id=27656&menu_url=publications_results.asp).
As Prof Dinesh K. Sharma sometimes say in his class, "**If you decide to
die poor, great many things can be done with your life.".** I believe by
poor he mean 'lack of money and resources'.  This habit have been
missing in our swinish 'Forbians'. \
\
Now Markets are not suitable for family and kinship then one will tend
to find loopholes in them to promote nepotism since the addiction of
kinship is deeply rooted in our society. Almost all of the political
parties have turned into family business. The city I currently live in,
Mumbai is dominated by a political party 'Shiv Sena'. It's supremo Bala
Saheb Thackeray have been unsparing in his criticism of Nehru that he
has converted congress into a family business. Well his ignorance about
Nehru notwithstanding, his own political party is now a family business.
Even the self-proclaimed Lohiaties Mulayam Singh has launched his son.
Most of the grass-root level corruption in India is due to this
'nepotism'. Either to promote his family and kins or to accumulate
wealth for them.\
\
For last one year, there have been a tremendous increase in the
literature about corruption in India. These study suggests that
corruption has been increasing both in magnitude and frequency. There is
no study (to my knowledge) whether my generation have more negative
views about it than their predecessors? If answer is in affirmative,
then my generation abhor corruption or it is just a lip-service? We'll
get to know. One of the student asked Ramachandra Guha when he was in
IIT Bombay about rising corruption and inept politicians. He was of the
view that it is true that 'we do not have equivalents of Nehru, Gandhi
and Patel' but it is being compensated by 'a rising civil society'. He
better be  damn right about it.\
\
The nexus between media and political parties is troublesome. The fourth
state has been undermined. It is a curious irony in nature that one
decline is often compensated by a 'rise'. If the decline of 'media' -
the fourth state - is obvious, then it is also true that we have seen
the emergence of 'fifth state' named technology. When 'Wikileaks' was
proving this point, twitter and blogs have forced newspapers to
'postmortem' the Radiia tape. Mainstream newspapers tried to suppress
it. This is not to say that past was innocent but in past, money and
market were the establishment and media was only a supporter. These days
its hard to tell whether media is becoming the part of this
establishment or 'have become the establishment itself'. Can one accuse
them playing in the hands of corporates when they themselves are
corporate houses searching 'holy grail' named profit at whatever and
whoever cost?\
