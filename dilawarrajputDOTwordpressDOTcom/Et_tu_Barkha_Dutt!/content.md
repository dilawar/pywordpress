 -- P. Sainath 

\

In last sixty years, overall degradation of public institutes in India
have been quite troublesome. It is remarkable that a generation which
was 70% illiterate could built up such kind of institutes which were
among the best in the world. May be, degradation of institutions have a
lot to do with degradation of public life and degradation of public
life, in turn, is due to degradation of public education.
Police, Bureaucracy, and Politics are our prominent rotten systems, not
probably in the same order. Out of these three, only politicians can
suffer directly from influenced public opinion. Bureaucrats and Police
generally have a lot of resources at their disposal to defend
themselves. Besides, our media never give them kind of attention they
really deserve. This make their task of defending themselves rather
easy. Poor Politicians! They are the only one who always make front
page, mostly for bad reasons. As one politician was joking about it
once, "*If we let the proceeding run, we do not make news. If we disrupt
it, we make the front page." *Then we have judiciary. We are not saying
that our j[udiciary is free from corruption and reforms are not
needed](http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/06/stories/2007090654860900.htm).
Over the last 60 years, there have been a degradation of judiciary also
and previous [record have been
patchy](http://www.hinduonnet.com/2002/02/22/stories/2002022200031000.htm).

\

Who tells us all of this? What is happening around us? Its the media,
right? And even sometimes, they claim to know why something is happening
around us.  Neither, one have time, nor resources, like Agent Skully and
Moulder to look out for truth which surely is out there. Now, if one
needs to believe in someone, one  has to put *trust* in him/her. Barkha
Dutt is one the journalist. A lot of people, especially form my
generation, have put their trust in her. Thus she deserves our scrutiny,
our anger and our frustration and sometimes even our judgments.\
\
Talking bad about rotten people is not something I write my blog for. I
generally devote my time and energy reflecting upon those whom I admire.
But this has been a special case. Point is, when someone like her does
something disgraceful, it propagates a wrong message and weakens people
trust. It becomes harder for those who believe that honesty do exists.
This belief is necessary till one gets mature enough to have his own
sense of existence. Second, it strengthen those who already have the
view 'Well, who is not corrupt (mostly followed by a chuckle)'. Others
may be worse than her, but they do not have a respectful place in my
conscious. If one capitalizes socially on one's clean image like Shashi
Tharoor, then its natural for public expecting their heads for
wrongdoings. This is a double edge sword. If 'holier than thou'
wrongdoer loose respect and their credibility, their supporters get
disillusioned. \
\
\
Great journalist? I really don't understand her circus on NDTV. 10-15
people suppose to debate something over there. Most of her chosen
contenders were as knowledgeable about the subject as anyone else who
watches it. They have not done any work. Mostly, they start thinking
when they enter in the studio and, for worse, they end up beating around
the bush. Even one or two dedicated people who come to make a point get
lost in hooliganism. And the cause is lost. Three Indians can not debate
properly and she has the galls to bring about 10-15. I never know what
she has on her mind. She could have done much better by inviting one or
two. But for TRP, circus is needed. Isn't it?

\

Let me tell you my biases first. Was I a big fan of her? No! I never
liked her. She made her career out of people misery. In Kargil. Brave?
If she was one she could not have done this deed. She has  not built her
reputation shred by shred. She is the classic example how people get
famous these days. No one can become genius/intelligent/authority in
subject in 6 months. She did! More than that, especially her constant
hobnobbing with Congress upper brass irritates me. Can I put my trust in
some-one who is so power hungry. She awarded Manmohan 'Leader of the
year or something' award and got a "Padma Shree" in return. Perfect
example of cooperative games. Second, I have learnt to be paranoid.
Well, if one is doing 'verification' of designed VLSI hardware, one has
to be paranoid. To detect a fault in a perfect looking piece of hardware
or software is not possible unless one is paranoid to the very core. I
admire people who are paranoid though avoid their company, and respect
those who are dissident (wants to write about them). Anything
significant ever came into this world, came through these two kind of
people. And she is none of them. So my chances of liking her is zero.
And I do not even want to comment about Vir Sanghvi. I never knew him.
First time I saw his picture, he looked like a porn star to me.

\

Ok, the deed is, probably you'll never know [PS : **now the issue is in
mainstream**]. As outlook magazine goes on to say, "**Now, If you depend
on just the Times of India or Hindustan Times for your daily news fix,
chances are you have missed the story that has put Indian journalism
under its fiercest gaze ever. For it turns out that a majority of Indian
journalism censors news about its own indiscretions."** This episode is
known as *Radia Tapes,*telephone conversation between Barkha Dutt, Vir
Shanghvi and corporate lobbyist Niira Radia ([of two
eyes](http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?268199))* *published by
Outlook and Open Magazine. Interestingly, no newspaper covered this for
first three days. Only some South Indian newspapers (first comment on
this blog provides link) were graceful enough to make a story out of it.
And guess, who asked serious question first. 4000 miles away, [Wall
Street
Journal](http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2010/11/22/does-the-buck-stop-with-barkha-dutt-and-niira-radia/)
and Washington Post. Had it not been for internet, they could have
killed it. But the news was too big to kill, so after 5-6 days even
Times of India published it. And it made it to its most shared list
where only soft porn could be found till date. 

\

Sivanti Ninan was not surprised at all. Writing in
[Hoot](http://thehoot.org/web/home/story.php?storyid=4959&mod=1&pg=1&sectionId=1&valid=true),
she laments,\

 Vidya Subramaniam, another hight profile journalist have this to say
about tapes (this one is my favorite),\

Here is the tapes, if you want to listen by yourself.\

Now one likes to give benefits of doubts to their loved one. Even then,
her position is not defendable. Vidya continues,** "Agreed, the tapes
establish no quid-pro-quo. But they do establish connections between
conversations and columns. Within a week of Radia offering the “national
interest” line, one column after another appears parroting the same
line. If this sounds incredible, just go to the Outlook website, hear
out the tapes and match the conversations with the columns that
followed."******What Radiia wants to do, one can understand. That she
does not care about society around her is probably natural. People who
make less investment in humanity, ends up finding a meaning of life in
money and power. A pretty picture for some!\

Now its not the first time that something so bad happened. [We have seen
paid news](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/article82768.ece) in
which so many media houses were involved.  The news was broken by
Sainath, The Hindu. He then wrote this on S[eminar
Magazine](http://www.india-seminar.com/2010/605/605_p_sainath.htm),\
\

It was not the 'maligned and dirty' politician who used media to mislead
people, it was,**'Large and very powerful sections of the media went out
and actively solicited, often extorted money from poll candidates.'** If
they paid, they**'received coverage that would have embarrassed the
court soothsayers of medieval kingdoms.'**And as usual, '**The
advertisements and propaganda were presented to readers as ‘news’.**If
out of poverty and or out of ethics one did not pay them the bribe then
they found **'their names were never once mentioned.'**No wonder 60% of
M.P. are multi-millionaire who represent a nation which has 770 million
people who lives below Rs. 20 a day. But this paradox never makes a
news.\
\

How much coverage did you see of this. [Even report of Press Council of
India, was reduced to a
joke.](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/article551851.ece)
To quote Sainath, 

> **The sub-committee finds passing mention in the “final” report. Its
> outstanding effort stands reduced to a footnote (yes, a footnote) in
> that report. The footnote says the sub-committee's report “may remain
> on the record of the Council as a reference document.” That's right.

Problem with this report was that it was pointing the fingers at people.
So these people of PCI - mainly those representing media
owners,**'worked to scuttle the explosive original report.'**They were
asking, '**Why name names? Why get into the ugliness of that?
Fascinating, at a time when the media are baying for names and blood on
the corruption in the Commonwealth Games scam.****So first, we now have
a double standard: exposure for corruption in the Games, privacy for it
within the media. Secondly, they fiercely opposed any reference to the
Working Journalists Act. In this, they acted as owners and employers.
Not as members of the PCI guarding the integrity of the press and its
standards."**Its exactly what she is doing. Double standards!\
\

And [one after
another,](http://www.stinkyjournalism.org/editordetail.php?id=954) this
new scandal hit the fan. And this time these are the holy cows of Indian
Journalism. Interestingly, both of them have done stories on 2-G scam
and A. Raja. What a fucking joke. They are the makers of Raja. They are
not denying the conversation, neither coming out in public to defend
themselves (PS: They have come out with a ridiculous defense. Barkha has
nothing much to offer. Only crocodile tears and 'blame everyone else for
what I have done.' ).

\
As they say in Hindi, "*Ek gandi machli pure talab ko ganda kar deti
hai."(one dirty fish can turn whole pond dirty.)* This might be correct
politically but I refuse to believe it. If we have India Today, Times of
India, HT, India T.V., Aaj Tak etc on one hand, on the other hand we
have Outlook, Economic and Political Weekly, Seminar, India Together,
Hoot, Frontline, Counter Current and  even Guardian Newspaper which
publishes a lot of material about India. Even NDTV have been cleaner
than most of the news channels. Indian media has been fair by most of
standards. One can extend one's sympathy  towards them since media is a
rather new kid and will take time to get mature. Let's hope like most of
the Indians, it don't get wise prematurely. Meanwhile one can ask, was
it necessary for her to be on the Niira's payroll? This reminds me of
Khushwant Singh and that lumpen despot Sanjay Gandhi. History will not
be kind to her! [There are even report that she has forced a blogger to
take down blog post and
apologize](http://www.writingcave.com/barkha-dutt-forces-a-blogger-to-take-down-blog-post-and-apologize/).
Too much from the protectors of free speech!

\
But again, India have this ironic history that the it's her famous among
the general public and the most successful, who are the most corrupt.
This has been a rule of thumb. The other peaks which India produces,
which no one can match, are mostly unknown to ever tweeting public. Have
you heard about P. Sainath, Sachin Chaudhary, K. N. Raj, and Seminar,
Economic and Political Weekly?\
\
In VLSI there is Moore law, which says that in 16 (you can change this
number though) months, the number of transistors on  chip doubles. Now I
propose a similar law for Indian media, "*In 16 (you can change this
too) months, truth in Indian newspapers halves!"*And this has been in
effect since the privatization of souls and intellect started in Indian
media.\
