Aman [Brigadier Amanullah, secretary to Benazir Bhutto and former chief
of Pakistan’s military intelligence in Sind, bordering India] noticed me
looking at the painting and followed my gaze. …\
\
“A rocket ship heading to the moon?” I asked. \
\
“No,” he said. “A nuclear warhead heading to India.” \
\
I thought he was making a joke. … I told Aman that I was disturbed by
the ease with which Pakistanis talk of nuclear war with India. \
\
Aman shook his head. “No,” he said matter-of-factly. “This should
happen. We should use the bomb.” \
\
“For what purpose?” \
\
He didn’t seem to understand my question. \
\
“In retaliation?” I asked. \
\
“Why not?” \
\
“Or first strike?” \
\
“Why not?” \
\
I looked for a sign of irony. None was visible… \
\
“We should fire at them and take out a few of their cities — Delhi,
Bombay, Calcutta,” he said. “They should fire back and take Karachi and
Lahore. Kill off a hundred or two hundred million people… and it would
all be over. They have acted so badly toward us; they have been so mean.
We should teach them a lesson. It would teach all of us a lesson. There
is no future here, and we need to start over. So many people think this.
Have you been to the villages of Pakistan, the interior? There is
nothing but dire poverty and pain. The children have no education; there
is nothing to look forward to. Go into the villages, see the poverty.
There is no drinking water. Small children without shoes walk miles for
a drink of water. I go to the villages and I want to cry. My children
have no future. None of the children of Pakistan have a future. We are
surrounded by nothing but war and suffering…”[1]\

What one Prominent Pakistani thinks his Country should do with its
Atomic Weapons’, *The Atlantic Monthly*, March 2002. Quoted in Ashish
Nandy, "[Narcissism and
despair](http://littlemag.com/security/ashisnandy.html)." There is more
on this but putting later part of his argument here will weaken the
central point he was making.
