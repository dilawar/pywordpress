Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering is designed to test your basics in
engineering. It has nothing to do with experiences in industries. By
engineering basics, I mean your core courses. You must know them. I was
bit troubled with all these mushrooming of GATE coaching centres on the
line of JEE and the way they 'buy' opinion to suit their business, so I
am writing this.\
\
I am pretty sure that one can succeed in exams without using these
centre. There is hardly any need of them unless you really can't do
anything without spoon feeding. But they create an atmosphere where one
can build a momentum to study - if one is occupied with 'inertia'.
Nonetheless, attending coaching classes is always better than doing
nothing. Anyway spend your time wisely. If you really have time to
spare, read quality books.\
\
It does not matter if problems asked in GATE are hard or easy.
Competition is tough, and it is getting tougher with the rise in numbers
of applications every year. Success in such competitions increases one's
confidence. But one should not take it as a benchmark of one's
capabilities - after all its an exam and that too of A, B, C, D type. If
one bad day in you exam should not make you loose your confidence then
one ultra-good day must not make you take undue pride in your
capabilities. Though the chances of possessed by later is much higher
than the former. In case of failure, there are many factors one can
blame. But success is always believed to be due to 'me and myself
only'.\
\
However, I must admit that 'success' is very necessary evil in one form
or other. It boosts one confidence - should one is unfortunate to have
little or moderate amount of it. But this 'confidence' evaporates easily
if stop putting lesser effort in her later ventures. Even on these
lines, GATE is not the only thing to strive for. From improving your
father's business to solving century old problems, there are many
options available.  Undue 'pride' and 'vanity' generally ruins people in
long run, so does a low self-esteem. If you are convinced that you can
not excel in GATE then there is no point writing this exam. If you let
failure hitting you, you will start thinking negatively about yourself.
There is no point reducing your self confident.\
\
One really does not have to go to any coaching center or to subscribe to
their costly preparatory materials. Get  previous examination papers and
solve them. Start early (say late December) and solve one or two
problems from each section every day. But one must solve them
completely. No cheating. If a problem takes 7 days, give it to that
monster. If you are not solving tough problems, you are just
bullshitting. Why would you solve a problem which is easy. This means
you already know it. Solving easy problem is cheating. Do not do that.
Save them for exams! Keep problem solving going on till neural path in
your brain align themselves to suit GATE.\
\
No one is suppose to read everything. If you have attended only few
classes in your course work and teacher was worse than the worst which
is usually true in 2nd tier institutes then you must give your course
book an easy reading. Just to make sure you know where '*this and that*'
concept is. Use books as reference material and not as a story book.
'Reading book' is your girlfriend, 'solving problem' is your wife. You
are allowed to spend time with both. Divide your time carefully that
meets need of your life. But don't do that in real life. Actually you
can! See, here problems reside in book, by that logic, your wife must
reside in your girlfriend. Then there is no problem.\
\
So bottom-line is that after watching latest animated movie, buy
previous years papers and solve them. When I say 'solve it'; I really
mean solve it. No matter how simple a problem look like. Convince
yourself that you understood it. It'd be a good idea if you masturbate
before you start solving, so that chances of distraction will be
minimum. Stay away from Internet, even if you have some e-affair going
on. Or at least try to refrain. Of course, there is time and place for
everything.\
\
Everyone is smart enough to understand that '**in the end, what you
think and what you feel is of little value**'. Your feeling and thoughts
should shape your work; that what ultimately counts. Don't run into
nihilism that there is no point in anything. What you do or have done,
ultimately, will be insignificant but it is very important that you do
it. Not only because it is useful but also If you do not occupy yourself
with something productive then you'll have the luxury of time to think
over whether you are happy or sad. And this is exactly when life starts
getting boring and miserable. I have added few arguments on top of what
Shaw and Gandhi have argued. \
\
And by the way, I know what I am talking about. Trust me!\

As usual. All the best.\
