It took a man like [Sainath
to](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/article2523649.ece?homepage=true)
break the story of paid news in public in the newspaper The Hindu.\
\
PCI (Press council of India) made a committee to look into the matter of
paid news which came down heavily on 'the big guys'. The report they
submitted named the names which the 'big guys' did not like. They
successfully buried its report - in the watered down version of this
report, original report was reduced to a footnote. Some excerpts from
this original report were made available by [Outlook
magazine](http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?266542).\
\
Delhi High Court has asked to made this report public on PCI website in
response to an RTI by Oct 10, 2011. It has not done it so far (at the
time writing this blog). There was no response from PCI to an email I
sent. \
\
SOME EXCERPTS :\
\
In recent years, corruption in the Indian media has gone way beyond the
corruption of individual journalists and specific media organizations --
from “planting” information and views in lieu of favours received in
cash or kind, to more institutionalized and organized forms of
corruption wherein newspapers and television channels receive funds for
publishing or broadcasting information in favour of particular
individuals, corporate entities, representatives of political parties
and candidates contesting elections, that is sought to be disguised as
“news”.\
\
...\
This report tracks the blurring boundaries between news and
advertisements/advertorialsand highlights the efforts made by
individuals and representatives of organizations whohave painstakingly
chronicled the selling of editorial space for money during elections\
\
...\
\
The entire operation is clandestine. This malpractice has become
widespread and now cuts across newspapers and television channels, small
and large, in different languages and located in various parts of the
country. What is worse, these illegal operations have become “organized”
and involve advertising agencies and public relations firms, besides
journalists, managers and owners of media companies. Marketing
executives use the services of journalists – willingly or otherwise – to
gain access to political personalities. So-called “rate cards” or
“packages” are distributed that often include “rates” for publication of
“news” items that not merely praise particular candidates but also
criticize their political opponents. Candidates who do not go along with
such “extortionist” practices on the part of media organizations are
denied coverage.\
\
....\
\
The regulator of the country’s capital markets, the Securities and
Exchange Board of India (SEBI), has written to the Press Council of
India on the issue of “private treaties” between media companies and
other corporate entities and suggested disclosure of financial holdings
and mandatory enforcement of  guidelines to ensure that the interests of
investors are adequately safeguarded – these suggestions have been
endorsed by the Press Council of India which, in 1996, drew up a set of
guidelines that are particularly applicable to financial journalists.\
\
....\
\
Identical articles with photographs and headlines have appeared in
competing publications carrying bylines of different authors around the
same time. On the same page of specific newspapers, articles have been
printed praising  competing candidates claiming that both are likely to
win the same elections. Nowhere is there any indication that the
publication of such “news” reports has entailed financial transactions
or has been sponsored by certain individuals or political parties. \
\
....\
\
Such malpractices have destroyed the credibility of the media itself and
are, therefore, detrimental to its own long-term interests. It needs to
be noted in this context that so long as journalists (in particular,
those who work in non-urban areas) are paid poverty wages or are
expected to earn their livelihood by doubling up as advertising agents
working on commissions, such malpractices would continue to be rampant.\
\
....\
\
The owners of media companies need to realize that in the long term,
such malpractices undermine not just democracy in the country but the
credibility of the media as well. Civil society oversight can also deal
with the problem, but only to an extent. New rules and guidelines can be
introduced and extant ones modified or amended. For instance, there
should be a debate among all  concerned stakeholders as to whether a
directive of the Supreme Court of India that enjoins television channels
to stop broadcasting campaign-related information on candidates and
political parties 48 hours before polling takes place can and should be
extended to the print medium since such a restriction does not apply to
this section of the media at present.\
\
....\
\
FOR INSTANCES AND EXAMPLE OF SUCH PHENOMENON, SEE THE REPORT.\
\
As a concerned citizen, I urge all readers of this blog, to boycott such
media-groups unless they issue a public apology. Such action not only
produce misleading information but also undermine the very democracy
which has given them 'freedom of expression' which a few countries
outside U.S. and Europe are able to provide to their citizens.\
