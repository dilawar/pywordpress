[![English: Ashis Nandy, receiving the Fukuoka
As...](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Nandy_ashis.jpg/75px-Nandy_ashis.jpg "English: Ashis Nandy, receiving the Fukuoka As...")](http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nandy_ashis.jpg)To
one of his admirers, no less than a Ramachandra Guha, Ashis Nandy is 'an
unclassifiable social scientist'. He mixes psychology and philosophy
with sociology to a magical effect, some would say to a corrupting
effect. I can not imagine anyone who would read him without being deeply
influenced. His masterpiece '[The intimate
enemy](http://www.amazon.com/Intimate-Enemy-Recovery-Under-Colonialism/dp/0195622375%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0195622375 "The Intimate Enemy: Loss and Recovery of Self Under Colonialism")' 
have decolonized some minds. His work continues to have a deep impact on
South Asian intellectual culture. He is surely one of the finest public
intellectuals of our time.

I can't comment much on the [merit of
his](http://tirchhispelling.wordpress.com/2013/02/11/प्रो-आशीष-नंदी-एक-नकारात्/)
work but I can comment something on his intellectual temperament. I
prefer people who has the intellectual temperament of a naturalist :
someone who is interested in finding things out for himself above
everything else. He is definitely more than that. To be sure, he is
deeply interested in 'interpreting the world' , but he also interested
in changing it for he do judgment of values and distinguish things
between right and wrong. Moreover he loves to surprise and edify his
readers. Perhaps this is why his email id starts with 'reasonbuster'.
Exuberant intellectuals often stretch the point and they mislead their
readers, sometimes knowingly.

His writings are very ambitious in scope. He establishes connections
among seemingly unconnected things and he moves from one conclusion to
another at a great speed. He questions and attacks, perhaps religiously,
well-established wisdom. The little magazine has called him the best
known voice of dissent.

I am a great admirer of Prof. [Andre
Beteille](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_B%C3%A9teille "Andre Béteille").
I am perhaps the youngest engineer alive in this world to do so. I
learnt it from him that an intellectual pursuit is, above everything
else,  to scratch the surface of confusion caused by observation and
experience. It is a hard process, 'a slow boring of hard boards' as Max
Weber called it once. I have always gotten carried away by Nandy till I
read what he wrote in the preface of  collection of his well-known
essays, 'I shall not grudge it if some enterprising reviewer finds
unconvincing history in the following pages, as long as he finds in them
convincing myths.'  and somewhere else in an essay '.. the way to fight
the myth : by building or resurrecting more convincing myths.' Reading
such statements makes one's stomach churn a little.  He is not the first
one to do so; [Georges
Sorel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Sorel "Georges Sorel")
understood the significance of myths and symbols for attracting the
masses towards various kind or religious and political movements very
well; and he wanted to engage people emotions rather than their reason.
By doing so, he hoped to channelize their energy for constructive
causes; and for that purpose he created his "myths". He was an odd type
of intellectual who thought poorly of "theory" yet spent his life
creating one. It would do us well to remember that his "myths" were put
to uses that were totally different from the ones for which he had tried
to create them. Historians or sociologists do not create myths; they
produce enough raw material from which other produces them. And they
oughtn’t create myths even when they are not expected to take any
responsibility for their creation.
