In his biographies,  especially when they are written by his fellow
*bhardalok Bengalis, * Rammohan Roy is usually subtitled '*The father of
modern India*'. It is an hyperbole and can be excused. Nonetheless, he
was certainly the first man on subcontinent who seriously engaged
himself with the challenges posed by modernity to traditional social
structures. He was roundly abused by orthodox (traditional?) Hindus, who
derided him as sinful atheist and '*modern blinded by passion*'.
European Christian was not warm to him either. They complained that he
opposed conversion and his admiration of Jesus did not extend to
acknowledging his divinity. [1]\

The accusation that Indian society is incapable of changing by itself
came from various Western thinkers. Most prominent among them was Karl
Marx, a man of immense intellect. In his essay, [The British Rule in
India](http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1853/06/25.htm), he
wrote that '**England, it is true, in causing a social revolution in
Hindostan, was actuated only by the vilest interests, and was stupid in
her manner of enforcing them. But that is not the question. The question
is, can mankind fulfil its destiny without a fundamental revolution in
the social state of Asia? If not, whatever may have been the crimes of
England she was the unconscious tool of history in bringing about that
revolution.'**Among others, a French anthropologist Louis Dumont is very
influential in academic circles. He wrote an authoritative book *Homo
Hierarchicus* about Indian society.\
\
These arguments that Indian society is incapable of changing or
'unalterably hierarchical' was built up during the high tide of imperial
rule. It was not built up in a day, and a great deal of scholarship went
into it. Both Indian and Western scholars contributed to it. Some
Indians who were bitter opponent of caste system contributed immensely
to this scholarship. But these assertions also had a certain political
capital behind them, namely, **if one can prove that they are
unalterably hierarchal then it becomes very easy to maintain that in
this modern world they are less fit for self-governance**. [2] \
\
Marx has been dead for more than 100 years and nothing original has been
contributed by Indian Marxists who were mostly interpreting Indian
society at their will to fit it in Marxists frameworks. The weakness of
Marx on Indian society has been shown by the time itself. Louis Dumont
still holds grounds and his book is an excellent work on Indian society
but his black and white picture of Indian as 'Homo Hierarchicus' needs a
serious revision for he did not consider modern India as a significant
part of it. Modern India is a significant part of India itself, both in
number and clout.    \
\
It would be mistake to think that modernization follows the same course
and leads to the same outcome at every place. Not all modern societies
are modern in same way, and all traditional societies do not have
cultural and social traditions of same kind. It is also not true that
traditional societies do not change by themselves. The changes are
generally slow and hard to detect for when traditional ways change
themselves by some institutional or cultural innovation, these changes
become part of tradition itself. Those who claims that traditional
societies do not change can be compared with a person who has developed
the habit of running. He sees strolling people as standing still.\
\
The perception of Modernity in India is not homogeneous, it varies
significantly from people to people and from place to place. In Northern
cities, like Delhi, modernity is almost defined as the negation of
traditions; while is southern cities like Chennai, modernity sits quite
harmoniously with their traditions. However these contrast should not be
overdrawn but these differences are quite sharp. Many times, traditions
are confused with antiquities. Traditions are well defined social
arrangements while antiquities are full of ambiguities. Antiquities are
always old, traditions need not be. The tradition of research is a very
new phenomenon Human history. It is hardly a century old even in
European countries but it is a tradition nonetheless.\
\
\
\
 What is more important is the level of strain between so called Modern
India and the traditional one. The idea of modernity does not look as
enticing as it used to be some 60 years ago when India got independence.
Indian State oriented its policies towards '*modernization*'. Todays,
even those who once claimed themselves to be 'modern' are not very
enthusiastic about it. They still do not criticize modernity in open but
they ask for caution before accepting anything (or everything) from
other societies which are  perceived as modern in general public due to
their economic superiority. Those who are more skeptical criticize it in
the name of 'Westernization' of Indian traditions. \
It is evident these days the modernization have its costs and sometimes
its cost might outweigh its benefits. For example the 'sexual
liberation' in the West has also increased teenage pregnancy and weaken
the families. The decline of tradition takes away many well-tested
values with it and pursuit of modernity may brings with it unforeseeable
problems.\
\
One of the most formidable voice of dissent, Ashish Nandy notes that
'*as India gets modernised, religious violence is increasing',*and he
admires '*traditional ways of life [which], over the centuries,
developed internal principles of tolerance.'*In India, secularism has
been criticized vis a vis modernization. In Nandy's sharp conclusion,
"*To accept the ideology of secularism is to accept the ideologies
progress and modernity as the new justification of domination, and the
use of violence to achieve and sustain ideologies as the new opiate of
the masses.'*(quoted in [3] pp 299-300). There is concern about the idea
of an undivided India, which they say is less secure these days. They
laments that 'modern' Indians are not hesitating in using undemocratic
means to get done what they deem right. For example, violence in support
of son-of-the-soil or the religion often comes from the one of the most
modern section of the society. There were reports the anti-Muslim
violence in Gujrat had many supporters from NRI moneyed class. The
'*Telengana movement'*has been sustained by a modern section of society
so it marathi-manoos struggle in Mumbai. It is not my intention to put a
value on these acts or to argue whether the grievances of people are
real or not. What I wish to point out the '*passion of patriotism*' or
the '*spirit in an individual for the betterment of his nation*' reduces
rapidly as we move in to the more modern stratum of society. Their
relations with the nation or community will be more '*cost and benefit*'
related and it would be naive to expect them to behave otherwise.
Everywhere poor people tend to be more traditional. Invariably they are
also the more patriotic. Their patriotism may seem devoid of an educated
conscience but it is patriotism nonetheless.     * *\
\
No society can either be only modern or traditional. France is a very
modern society, yet they are very proud, not to say jealous, of their
traditions. Indian society, where traditions are deeply rooted, the
hunger for modernization is also very deep. Even in remote villages,
people are enticed by modern things. For one example, the mobile phone
which is a mark of modernity, is deeply coveted by those who may not
have any significant use of it. Some would say that it is a desire for a
status symbol but status symbols are the symbols which are universally
appreciated in a society. Any symbol which represents modernity, given
high hunger for being perceived modern, transforms itself into a status
symbol. Whether it is a mobile phone, or a refined English accent or
branded' clothes, they can easily become symbols of modernity. To some
intellectuals with refined sensibilities this hunger towards 'such
modernity' might be disconcerting. \
\
A hardcore modernist may not always see tradition with suspicion.
Although a great many of them do. India's first prime minister, Jawahar
Lal Nehru was a champion of modernization. He built many modern
Institutes which stood the test of time despite of many attacks at their
foundations. Yet he put a lot of premium on traditions and heritage of
India but when talked about heritage he chiefly had in his mind the art,
literature and philosophy and not the social custom of the day. These
'social custom of days' were deeply abhorred by another modernizer B. R.
Ambedkar. For him, Indian traditions stood for oppressive social customs
and must be done away with modern customs.\
\
\
To distinguish modernity from tradition, I would argue that modernity
see the world with somewhat more open and skeptical mind. I don't think
any society can survive, let alone flourish, by turning its back to
traditions. Traditions are an outcome of slow and painful learning and
there are great values hidden in them. They are not just dictated by
some scriptures. These scriptures can be made to look either modern or
medieval. If one reads ***Kalidasa*** via Rabindra Nath Tagore or Mohan
Rakesh, he sounds very modern. In some other writings, it might sound
very medieval. It would be all to good if modernity is used to refine
traditions to get rid of unwanted and disgraceful customs.\
\
The biggest asset of Modernity is it's will to experiment. There is
always a chance of finding something great out here and there, but what
look attractive at distance to a modernist might not produce the same
outcome as envisaged. \
\
In competitive populism, especially our media which takes quite a pride
in calling themselves modern and forward looking, traditionalist are
viewed with suspicion at best.  It would be unfair to classify them as
people who do not like changes. A traditionalist also like to see his
society changing for betterment but he would rather dig down in his own
traditions and culture to find the ingredients of change  rather then
turning to outside world. To him, culture and tradition hold infinite
wisdom. Tradition is a vast and inexhaustible storehouse where
innumerable secrets are hidden. They would look into it to regenerate
their society rather than looking out at world. It was evident when Bal
Thackerey was telling youths via his paper to celebrate 'Laila/Majnu
day' rather than celebrating it as Valentine day.\
\
So what does modernity stand for? Why there is so much hunger for a
particular kind of modernity in India, namely Western. One reason could
be the language English which has enabled Indian society to be more
porous for their influence. It is often a case in contemporary world
that society that are less advanced economically imitate those who are
more advanced mechanically and blindly without any consideration of its
ill effect or their capacity to absorb or integrate what they have
borrowed. Since the pressure to 'catch-up' is very high they also put
pressure on their leaders to act accordingly without any calculation of
long term costs or interests.\
\
It is not to say that we should not learn from Western civilizations. In
fact, we have much to learn form them. We have few things to teach also.
They can learn from our experiences in democracy and handling diversity.
We can learn how the best of their governments like Sweden and Norway
treats their poor citizen and women while ours show a tremendous
contempt towards them; how best of their scientists and engineers, say
US and Germany, turn their ideas in working models, ours sit on the
committees and publishes piles of papers or take prides in doing menial
jobs, most of them are of dubious quality; how their public institutes
are used to spread the sense of justice and law-and-order, ours are
being turned into public offices for private convenience.\
\
What is more distressing is the way we are perceive and practice
modernity. We are yet to learn to take what is best for us while leaving
unnecessary verbiage. Like Japan has done or Singapore is doing. It is
distressing to learn that people are preferring Madona over Ravishankar,
Paulo Coelho over R K Narayan, any arbitrary Western band over Indian
Ocean. Indian ocean is an classical example how 'modern people' can
suffocate indigenous invention simply because they cna not relate to
them. If this imitation is called modernity and its sole purpose it to
stands in the ways for ingenious innovations, then this imitation is
only an impediment to modernization. Any impediment to modernity will
not augur well for our society. Modernity despite of its all
shortcomings punishes those who joins it late and it punishes them
rather severely.\
