I am facing a real dilemma, how you feel when you are surrounded by
really SERIOUS people who not just look serious, talk serious, may be
think serious and perhaps eat serious. Most importantly, they give me a
serious look, worse than my mother used to give me whenever I forgot my
schoolbag in primary school in early childhood. It really patrified me.
Not even students, prof here also the same with some exception of
course. Well i am not going to talk about them, i am still here and
don't want to be thrown out of the IIT right away.\
Now i am really serious about this seriousness, i want to think about
it. What really seriousness is? Why think when you have wikipedia
around. i checked it, it is also not that much serious, nothing is
there. Then dictionary.com, " *requiring effort or concentration;
complex and not easy to answer or solve*". oops, if it is seriousness,
then in MPD class i am damn serious, but most of the people say they get
serious to solve some problem, not to just get confused, so i am not
serious in MPD class. honestly, i feel only one thing about being
serious, when people are around and you are serious, then you want to
show your importance or difference, if you are alone and you are
serious, then your life is miserable or perhaps out of track. When you
are serious while you are studying or working, then you want to fool
yourself that you can do better than you can really do. In any case I
dont find it honest to be serious in any part of life.\
Confusing thing about it that everyone has a diffirent definition of
seriousness. So i think its futile to carry on this thing which is
subjective.
