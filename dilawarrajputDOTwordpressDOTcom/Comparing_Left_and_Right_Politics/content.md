Following table is an outcome of notes taken for sole purpose of
generalising Left and Right politics. Left politics is usually confused
with ideology of some political parties. Such views of politics in
popular media are confusing if not contradictory. The distinction made
between Left and Right was of French origin where the Left is called
"the party of movement" and the Right "the party of order". To be sure,
there is no black-and-white distinction between these two political
culture. It is often the case that a Right wing party takes a Leftist
stand on one issue and a Left-wing party takes Rightist stand on
another. However there are differences between these two culture which
can not be denied.\
\
In India, parenting and childcare is not perceived as something which
can have socio-political colours. We include it here. In our media, the
idea of politic is poorly debated. The popular belief - that 'politics
is what a politician does' - is widespread. It should not be surprising
since the idea of 'politics' is often confused with its Hindustani word
'Rajneeti' (codes of ruling). \
