Sixty years after the the independence, two phenomena are ubiquitous
these days. One is the manner in which [public
anxiety](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/article927895.ece) shows
itself over many problems with which our public institutes are beset -
misuse of funds, lack of discipline, absenteeism, work stoppage, strikes
and so on - **all of which are in some way related with failure of some
regulatory rules**. Second, the growth of civil societies which seems to
be outcome of government failure on social front, like markets which
were the outcome of government failures on economic front.\
\
From the behemoth state to the smallest government Institute, there is
an addiction to 'create rules of every kind and to the last detail'.
After these rules are created to the last details, they are discarded.
And then there is a demand for new one. These 'activity of creating a
rule and discarding the same' is not a malfunction of  government but it
is rather a Indian culture of dealing with rules. There are many people
who are aware of this and disturbed by it but they can do little about
it. [Irawati Karve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irawati_Karve) has
given this rule about Indian society and it seems to be always
operative, '**The addition of new rules does not lead to the elimination
of old ones; they are simply put into cold storage, to be taken out when
required to trip up any unwary newcomer who tries to inject some
dynamism into the system.' **\
\
Our orientation towards rules seem to be indigenously our own. We differ
totally in our orientation from other cultures. There is an ambiguity in
our rules. Many perceive them the way they like because multiple
convenient interpretations are allowed. It can lead to a severe
breakdown of system. It was all visible in A. Raja's acts dealing with
telecom policy in 2G scam. He was not only able to use the part of the
rules and interpret them as he wished but also he was able to do it
quite easily.\

\
[Bankimchandra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankim_Chandra_Chattopadhyay),
a nineteenth century writer was troubled by tendencies of some of his
contemporaries to quote prescriptions  from the shashtras to support one
or another reform they wish to promote. He found these rules to be
prolix. He wrote, '*Indeed, it is not possible in any society to be
fully regulated by all the prescriptions to be found in the shashtras of
Manu and the others. It is doubtful if ever, at any time, those
prescription were fully operative in any society. Many of them are
inoperable, involve such hardship to men that they would drop out on
their own. Many are mutually contradictory. If any society is ever
destined to keep all the prescriptions in operations, such a society has
indeed an evil destiny.' (Quoted in [1])*Those who get frustrated by the
maze of rules in offices can find some solace in Bankim reflection on
past.\
\
\
Now how people used to get their work done in the face of this plethora
of inconsistent, obsolete and unclear rules? According to Andre
Beteille, '*They improvise, activate personal networks and go about
their business without paying too much attention to the rules. This
probably is how they worked system in the past, and this is how they try
to work it today.' ** *\

\
These days societies are not only much bigger to live face-to-face but
also organized in very different ways. When they come into contact with
other societies for trade or business; they expect to honor the
agreement by some law or rule. Even in our business class, which suppose
to understand the value of a consistent system and trust, is notorious
is flouting rules and breaking trust if the party at receiving end is
powerless such as farmers and workers etc.. I am not sure how taking the
streets with the demand of new rules will be effective without a radical
change of the orientation towards the regulatory rules of society?\
