 -- P. Sainath, in 1994

During my under-graduation in 2005, I read his article first time in
Hindu newspaper. It was pleasantly surprising to notice someone in media
knows village  and its life intimately. Never before I had come across
anything so authentically written on our lives in any newspaper. Its not
like villages have not been studied by middle class intellectuals, but
barring sociologists, anthropologists and some rare economists but these
people usually don't find spaces in our newspapers. Journalists do write
about villages and villagers but their writing is animated by wishful
thinking. They rarely write about villagers as they see them. Even if
they go to a village, they talk to some  'activist'  and next day his
life is advertised as 'the ideal middle-class life' for their consumers.
They are interested in eyeball-catching virtuous lifestyles, of which
there is great demand among young, and not in opinions of farmers and
villagers on what is ailing them. He is altogether a very different
breed of  journalist: he religiously spend more than 260 days a year in
villages. While most of the journalists were busy lobbying for their
consumers and advertisers, he showed little interest in becoming a
'stenographer to the powerful'. He was interested in bottom 10% of the
society in an industry which cares about only top 10%. Since he compare
and contrast the bottom 10% with the top 10%, it makes the top 10%
uncomfortable. He holds the mirror in front of 'Beautiful People' and
shows them their ugly spot. Graduated in history, he became an authority
on rural economy and agriculture, and by extension, as Prof. Amartya Sen
labeled him, one of the [world's greatest experts on famine and
hunger.](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=9078987899127917834) He
came under severe attack for not showing faith in the [religion of
market](http://www.india-seminar.com/2001/497/497%20p.%20sainath.htm).
Nonetheless, He got many admirers. A supreme court judge wrote that his
"*name should be written in letters of gold in the history of India
journalism*". It must be! [Documentaries were
made](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0459573/) on his journalism and his
journalism is being [discussed in
classrooms](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Intp4IUphPo). Collection of
his articles and news reports  are used as handbook by NGOs. In
Scandinavia, the United Kingdom and Canada people found relevance in it
for their own countries. In the United Kingdom it is being used by
journalists to cover local issues of poverty and by more than 30
universities around the world. He has done a great service to his
profession. Google scholar reports that his work is often cited in
sociology and economics journals. What are journalists for? Like
intellectuals, they are the keeper of nation's conscience but both serve
different purpose. He belongs to a tribe where a journalist stands for
some value. All radical journalists have stood for some value. And those
who stand for some value not only report, they often provoke. They have
the belief the it is OK to stretch the point somewhat if it serves a
greater cause. Their work may not be immensely valuable for a
sociologist but they preserve the conscience of the nation for
posterity. Historian Ramachandra Guha thinks that 'a journalist work is
immensely valuable if a future historian can reconstruct the past from
it'. How many journalists will pass the test of 'future historian'
today? I am not sure how many professionals today would like to be known
posthumously by their work rather than the name of organization they
work for. In those pre-color days, many believe that it was journalists
who build a niche of their newspaper by their work; they wrote for
public and in turn, they were hugely admired by public. They were
inspiration to future journalists. Guardian's
[editor-in-chief](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/jan/25/cudlipp-lecture-alan-rusbridger)
remembers why he loved some journalists because to him *"they seemed to
represent the best of journalistic virtues – courage, campaigning,
toughness, compassion, humour, irreverence; a serious engagement with
serious things; a sense of fairness; an eye for injustice; a passion for
explaining; knowing how to achieve impact; a connection with readers ...
but, more importantly, about why [journalism] mattered".* If you are
looking for a journalist who posses these qualities, ask for that
[incorruptible and feisty rural
reporter](http://www.indiatogether.org/opinions/psainath/) named P.
Sainath. The sort of journalism which Sainath champions is on decline
for newspapers are increasingly getting more interested in
entertainment. They claim that they are forced to do it because this is
what their readers want. This is odd for they rarely ask their readers
what they want to read. Besides one of their heroes of corporate media,
Steve Jobs has proved that, 'consumers do not know what they want unless
you show it to them'. Even if we believe for the sake of their argument
that their readers are really interested in all this; this can not be
expected from newspapers. For 'this is a kind of argument a drug paddler
would make,'  rues Sainath, 'Look! I am decent guy, these assholes on
the street want this stuff. What can I do?'. Perhaps this is exactly the
sort of thing which has happened. There is a little difference left
between the business model of a drug paddler and a media house. While
the business model of a drug paddler is 'illegal' and low on public
sympathy, newspapers can get away with the noise of 'self-regulation'.
Media houses will do well to remember that this right of free speech --
indeed any right -- is not absolute. A society can hardly have a healthy
future when its members care only for their rights and show no
inclination for discharging their duties. Besides public sympathy is not
an inexhaustible commodities, ask Manmohan Singh. The noise that "our
prime minister is most learned since Jawaharlal Nehru and least corrupt
since Lal Bahadur Shashri" is almost gone. If the media does not
regularize itself, someone else in power will. When they will find that
public sympathy is no longer on the side of media. Indian media will do
well to learn some lessons from what happened to media autonomy in U.K.
after Leverson report.
