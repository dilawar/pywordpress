These following notes are not coherent and need five or six careful
readings. The links given in this posts are worth reading and a lot of
the arguments made here are influenced by these readings. \
\
 \
Our most of the traditional 'love stories' have a tragic end. We do not
have 'happily ever after' in our love stories. In addition, these love
stories do not contain elaboration of 'romance' or 'romanticism'. Those
romantic gestures such as 'first kiss', 'midnight kiss', 'dance' etc.
which are an integral part of western love stories are nil in Indian
one. Details on 'how both of them starts loving each other?' are also
very limited in our stories but the tragic part would be elaborated very
well. This also helps making its reader (especially children/teenagers)
aware of what are the worst that could happen if they follow that path.
A typical Indian love story mainly emphasizes that if you chase your
heart you will suffer a lot, most of the time as premature death.
Perhaps that explains why Indian are so timid in choosing life partner
by themselves. Mostly, they go for arranged marriages, a partner chosen
by parents or guardians which have a social approval. However, there is
a very steep increase in number of love marriages in urbane India in
last decade. \
\
In our stories, the love between the duo is always 'pure' or 'perfect'.
Even in our movies - which 'educate' almost all of our teenagers - we
are still to see  a genre in which male or female protagonist suffer
from the 'infidelity' caused by the partner. The challenges which our
'lovers' in our Movies face mostly are the handiworks of society or some
'[villains' or 'family protecting their so called
honors](http://www.hinduonnet.com/mag/2002/11/03/stories/2002110300560300.htm)'.
[These resistance to love marriages are still
there](http://epw.in/epw/uploads/articles/10728.pdf), but the urbane
India has shown a decline in these matters.   \
\
The most ubiquitous is the teenage love in modern India. Teenagers of
India are not studied by sociologist as the way our tribal are studied.
Somehow they have shown a tremendous indifference toward them. They go
to the far away lands to study the tribal but have failed to produce
good social studies on teenagers. Nonetheless, in post face-book time,
when you can virtually traceback the life of an individual (with little
practice and certain safeguards against bias), the time is ripe for one
more M. N. Srinivas.\
\
[Vijay
Nagaswamy](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/Vijay_Nagaswami/), a
regular contributor to an estimable newspaper "*The Hindu"* has
something to say,\

So arranged marriages are now being replaced by arranged love in which
you are free to love a person your family have no problems with. Someone
tempted to simplify this problem and wrote in *'Times of India'* (at
best a tabloid in disguise of a national newspaper) that our teenagers
'*are caught in between soul-mate hunting and having casual
relationship*'. This argument will make sense to a person who grows up
watching M. Tv. and reading Chetan Bhagat. While our traditional values
does not allow us to go for no-string love affairs, our work culture
does not go very well with arranged affairs where mobility and
compatibility issues make them unattractive.    \
\
OPTIMAL MATING STRATEGIES\
\
In almost all of the species, mating has the ultimate goal of
reproduction. Humans do not like to talk about relationships in those
terms since our [evolved sense of
ethics](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/magazine/13Psychology-t.html)
makes it taboo to talk about emotions in these plain ways. Language, if
we consider it as a tool built for the purposes to influence other
people thoughts/ideas, is the first victim of morality. You are NOT
suppose to utter certain words e.g. penis  or vagina in public, however
some mild terms or *euphemism*are allowed. Indirectly you can say the
same thing which is banned to be said directly. So I can say that '*I
married her because I loved her*' rather than saying '*I married her
because she was the optimal choice I had for mating*'. Saying something
that way might get you divorce in record time.\
\
So do we invest in other gender just for offspring? And of course, in
Human and some other mammals, there is *fun*factor also. [Then the
question arises why only few species has *let themselves* evolved in
such way that enables them to do sex  just for
fun.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_sexual_behaviour#Interpretation_of_animal_sexuality) Doing
sex is very energy extensive. Brainwork also take a lot of energy. In a
lot of species, brain is as much evolves as much they needed without
wasting any energy. Humans, after gaining access to energy (via hunting
and agriculture), had a lot of energy to be spared for a well developed
brain. Is it that we have so much energy at our disposal, we do sex for
fun. We assume that if every time sex does not produce a offspring, it
is for fun (or orgasm). This certainly fails to explain why animals do
homosexual act even if their heterosexual deeds are not for fun (Do they
fail to figure out whether it is a female?).\
\
Among humans, language is a new phenomena and its implications are being
studied. Communication through words (language) enables people to
understand other people in better ways. More the access to people,
better as the chances. A gender, which generally has more at stakes
while choosing a partner (e.g. woman) tends to vie for information about
them. That can explain why ladies are so interested in gossips. Gossips
provides them with valuable information about possible relations. Once
it become a habit, it looses it main purposes. Surely, I'd love to argue
that woman are more interested in gossiping because they have evolved in
an environment in which the only way they could gather information about
potential partners was communicating with other women. It has been said
that a woman love by her ears while a man love by his eyes. Even in
those days, young boy will go for pics in a girl facebook profile. What
about girls, do they read the info first? Can I say that man liked big
boobs because they thought that she will be able to feed their offspring
well before it became a habit in them. In modern times, a boys liking
towards female breast may not be dependent on this. The influence of
media, and well connected information flow have their impact on young
mind. Big breast means better nourishment for babies may be universal in
olden days,  and that is why all the man across the globe have liking
for them. While some local preferences which are being evolved under
media influence, like skinny legs, fair skin, cleavage showing dresses
may not be liked universally. [Which way this will evolves, one
(especially girls) should worry for future
generation](http://littlemag.com/bodypolitic/index.html). We, the boys,
generally get what we want in some way or other.\
\
Anyway, people are very much connected these days and the sense of
morality and ethics are evolving in a way which is making society more
homogeneous. An English speaking Indian surely does not find many
western things taboo as they did 100 years ago. We here concentrate over
people who are self sufficient to be able to make more independent
decisions about their mating partners.\
\
Steven Pinker, writing in his essay "The literary animal" in "Philosophy
and Literature" has discussed sexual selection ([I am not going to cite
references, see this paper
here](http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/index.html)). Some 
snippets,\

>   "Like the other contributors, Gottschall interprets the resonance of

> as elaboratedby Robert Trivers.6 The sex with the greater minimal
> investment in off-spring is selected to be more choosy; the sex with

> neither can your spouse."

About a woman's mate preference, he continues\

> "When it comes to short-term affairs, women should prefer fit,
> dominant men, who can provide any offspring with good genes; when it
> comes to long-term relationships, they should prefer nurturing,
> well-heeled men, who can provide their offspring with care and

> romantic fiction: the “proper hero” (a sensitive, decent mensch) and
> the “dark hero” (a dominant, dashing outlaw). The women in their
> study, as they had predicted, reported that they would prefer to hook
> up sexually with the dark heroes, but that they liked the proper
> heroes more, and would prefer them as long-term partners, husbands,
> and sons-in-law."

So that partly explains why our most of  otherwise *successful* IIT
classmates are still single. Given the fact that IIT graduates are one
of the most successful categories of Indians. Most of them go for
arrange marriages (*they always get a better deal this way*). A
beautiful girl form rich family and a large sum of dowry which is like a
feather in their crown. Number of *generic successful * - A success
which is admired by the masses e.g. JEE rank 01 is more generic than
gold medal in Mathematical Olympiad since a lot more people are able to
appreciate success in JEE or Gold medal in Institute is more generically
successful than someone who has done a path-breaking Ph.D. in an obscure
field - bachelors are limited in India and beauty and money can be found
in very nooks and cranny of society. So the deal goes like this, in lieu
of a *generic successful*son-in-law which they can boast in public, you
get the beauty and the money. Everyone is happy this way.**That can
explain sexual selection of grown-ups living under the influence of
societies ( We still have not touched the underlying choice theory).\
\
What about college graduates living in campus where influence of the
society is minimum (at least for non-lethal short term relationships) or
people living in small villages?\
\
Well, for villages or small community, people do make choice which goes
well with the predefined community structure. If going by the rules of
my village, I can not marry even a film star if she does belongs to a
cast inferior to me (unless she agrees to buy every opinion in my
village, If you have money, you can always *educate* people!). On
college campuses, esp students, are cases worth noticing since in this
life people do make choice with minimum social pressure on their head.\
\
When people are just individuals, choice theory become more relevant.
Though it assumes that if a large number of choices are given, people
will make an informed choice which is better for them. But some time
earlier, a study was done by [Sheena
Iyengar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p-QWwYMsB4) (you tube video)
which is worth noticing is making shock waves in economics and social
circles.\
\
Here is about this study by [Aditya Chakarbarty who writes in Guardian
Newspaper,
CIF](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jul/20/more-choice-not-helpful-society)
\

Is it to say if are given a lot of choices, we will simply choose the
best option which is considered best for us by others (Hey, His babe is
hot man!) without being able to judge which is better for us? Well here
in IIT, We know the answers well before they came up with this studies.
Come to see IIT counseling, every years our top rankers follows the same
pattern, UG's or PG's. Girls or boys (save some freaks, of course.
Mostly doing different things to assert their individuality - I like
them.). And amazing we are the people who seem to understand that "We
are what we choose" (at least to put on Facebook or tweeter). Funny!   \
