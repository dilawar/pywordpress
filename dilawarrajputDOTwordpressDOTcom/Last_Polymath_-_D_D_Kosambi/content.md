[Damodar Dharmananda
Kosambi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damodar_Dharmananda_Kosambi)
belonged to rarest breed of Indian scholars - a polymath. Trained as a
mathematician, he did seminal work in history of India. 'D. D. Koshambi
along with R. K. Sharma and Daniel Thorner', says Irfan habib, 'brought
Indian peasants into the study of history of India'. I like to see him
as *Premchand* of Indian History. Before Premchand, Hindi literature was
about kings and queens, away from the real world of masses. Indian
history, before Koshambhi, was the same : a point he himself made in his
'Introduction to the study of Indian hostory'. Varrier Elvin did the
same with Indian tribal.\
\
Finding polymath in the history of modern India is hard, and harder
these days. In addition to his multiple skills, he also had a wonderful
grip over languages. He published in French, German, Italian, Japanese,
Chinese, and Russian journals. [He became a historian sympathetic to
Marxism](http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1918/19180720.htm) which
enabled him reconstructing the social and economic and social life of
the civilization long dead. He hated to be known as "official Marxist"
or 'OM' for short. Though these days, OMs consider him one of their
own.\

\
Kosambi was weak in body as well as in Mathematics in his early days at
Poona. While at Harvard Grammer School, He improved in both of them and
called himself 'strongest mathematician' (in physical sense). He
believed that 'specialization' is a form of 'semi-illiteracy'. That
surely did not go well against him. In this world of science which is
thought to be capitalist in nature, specialization is very much
appreciated. Here, In India, our universities, put a lot of premium on
'specialization', In addition, our universities are also hostile towards
'other-forms of knowledge'. But even in 'so-called-better' universities
of the West, things perhaps are NOT much different. After being
encouraged by his father to go along the path he has chosen, to acquire
as much of scholarship he desired. Kosambi used the freedom granted in
American University to offer 18 courses in a year. He valued what he
called, “*Renaissance type of versatility: wide range of know­ledge
without sacrificing depth*”. When I think about it I can somehow equate
it with what Donald E. Knuth likes, \

\
If you intelligent enough, that reason alone is enough to get you
eliminated from a system. There is a story about Paul Samuelson that
Harvard made no attempt to keep him, even though he had, by then,
developed an international following. Solow said of the Harvard
economics department at the time: “*You could be disqualified for a job
if you were either smart or Jewish or Keynesian. So what chance did this
smart, Jewish, Keynesian have?*” In case of our Kosambi, He was also an
*idealist*. And he suffered from a prevalent disease of idealist a
*tendency to say what he has to say. Outspoken!*Well, in our time,
people are not forced to drink poison like Socrates, so he survived with
a good sanity. Perhaps he had a 'sense of humor', it always helps
maintaining a reasonable sanity.\
\
The pursuit of 'specialization' was not only a form of illiteracy but
also 'unethical' to him. The 'expert raj' where few expert control the
direction of the profession may have be 'abusive' for him. A professor
at my department told me once,\

> Do not make Mathematics your profession, keep it as a hobby. There are
> few great man have already said something about math. Other people,
> just to prove that they are intelligent, works on their idea.

Though this regime of 'specialization' is very useful for 'capitalists'
or 'industries', people are realizing its hostility towards scientific
progress. Science is nowadays more of 'getting funds' than 'getting
truth'. Now it has become a 'holy cow' of the society. After cinema and
politics, it is the most prominent source of glamor. Among the students,
the notion that famous universities are the better universities is the
reeks of this culture (well, mostly they are!). But hey, reputation is
also build by work done on these institutes.\
\
Kosambi saw this as 'nothing less than a superstitious'. It is a common
mistake to suppose that this sort of thing happens only in India. For
example, Stephen [Hawking’s singularity theory is a sophisticated
discourse on
creationism](http://11picsoftime.ckraju.net/11picsoftime/index.html).
But few people, even among relativists, understand singularity theory.
So, to decide scientific truth, they weigh social authority. Thus,
millions can be persuaded about creationism simply by marketing Hawking
as the new scientific messiah. You may have used the words like "Newton
once said .... " and "Eisentien once said ... " [to weigh the public
opinion in your
favor](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/aug/13/wisdom-masses-online-debate)
before even making your point. Take it from me, you are either not
confident about your argument or worse don't know what you are saying.\
\
In India, science (western science) flourishes quite rapidly when Indian
elites concluded (rightly or wrongly,) that we were inferior because we
were colonized because we lacked 'science' and became 'superstitious'.
During the first part of the 20th century, with Calcutta at its center,
science was pursued in missionary mode.\
\
Post-independence, however,  science became kind of a quest of fund.
Name any big name in Indian science, they were the holder of the biggest
funds without any accountability (that how one define Mafia, right?)
which He resisted. \

At Harvard, due to his non-compliance to pursue only a narrow specialty,
he was not given fellowship to pursue. He came to *Banaras Hindu
University,* and despite of sympathetic Madan Mohan Malviya, he did not
find atmosphere there conducive for knowledge. The he shifted to
*Aligarh Muslim Universityi*where Math department was headed by Andre
Weil of [Bourbaki
fame](http://books.google.com/books?id=-CXn6y_1nJ8C&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=Bourbaki+fame&source=bl&ots=ushtA-RhKM&sig=Dzxv89NDIZBzV3HTdarTkQN4NBM&hl=en&ei=dptuTMCzF4ryuAOXy8xB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Bourbaki%20fame&f=false),
another polymath and lover of Sanskrit. He could not handle the politics
over there and soon sacked. By the way, despite of glorious past, both
*Banaras Hindu University*and *Aligarh Muslim University* are at their
nadir. In India, most of the Institutes which did not have any hand of
Nehru in their foundation have collapsed.\
\
Like his father, he also took up a low-paid job in the nearby Fergusson
College, where he taught mathematics for many years. As recognition for
his research in path geometry, he received the Ramanujan prize in 1934.
He described this situation as 12 years *vanvas* (banishment to a
forest), for he lived in *Erandavane*, and had no one with whom he could
discuss his mathematical research. His students were only interested in
passing examinations to secure a job. The few mathematicians he could
interact with in Poona included a person with the improbable name of
*Wrangler* Paranjape, who carried his undergraduate achievements in
Cambridge as a sort of British-conferred title all his life (and even
beyond, in that at least one building was named after him) though he
never did any research in mathematics. The anecdote goes that, one day,
Paranjape arrived to meet Kosambi and was late by some 10 minutes. An
annoyed Kosambi, who had imbibed the value of punctuality in the US,
opened the door himself and said “*Professor Kosambi is not at home*”
and then shut it. (There are other, milder, versions of this anecdote.)
One must recall that as principal of Fergusson College, Paranjape had
given jobs, even if only ill-paid ones, to both Bapu and Baba
Kosambi.[1]\
\
Eventually, Fergusson College sacked Kosambi, on the alleged grounds
that students did not understand the mathematics he taught. I give them
one LOL. Mathematics is all together a very difficult subject to teach,
especially to exam-oriented students in India. If one tries to teach the
subject in its proper spirit, as Kosambi did, one loses most of one’s
students whose aim is a job or a degree, and not knowledge. The best
lectures I ever had in Mathematics was from Prof. Narayanan in Advanced
Network Analysis Course about which he generally says, "*You were
horrible. It is a chaos. You were failed it but the concept of failure
is not clear in my mind so you got the grade you got!".* I now take it
as a compliment. He can also be sacked on the same grounds. \
\
Forced out of his *vanvas,*Homi Bhabha put him in *TIFR* (a very
prominent Indian institute of Modern time).\
\
As it is well known, Kosambi commuted from Poona on the Deccan Queen,
switching from daily commute to weekend commute and back to daily
commute. Seven hours journey! He used to carry a hell lot of books to
read on the train and he loved the countryside on the way. “history was
not only in the past but also in the present”, said someone about him,
so his thoughts on these journeys naturally turned to history. His book
on history was written on the Deccan Queen during these lengthy
commutes. Since he had a few kilometres to go on the Bombay side, first
to Kenilworth, on Peddar Road, and then to the Old Yacht Club at Gateway
of India, and finally to Holiday Camp (now Navy Nagar) beyond Afghan
church, Kosambi naturally joked that TIFR was just a “third-class
waiting room”, which he used between train journeys. I can only imagine
Prof. Dinesh K Sharma having this sort of energy and enthusiasm. About
him I generally mock, If you dissect him, you will find a small nuclear
reactor.\
\
\
 Prof. Narayanan was happy that I did not got admission at Institute of
Mathematical Sciences for these guys would have not given you time to
build up the mathematics and my confidence would have been broken. In
general, mathematicians are alleged ' to have little or no sense of
humor' and being 'stingy'. Ultimately he was sacked from TIFR also,
partly for his *prank* he played about Riemann hypothesis and party his
colleague at TIFR were undignified enough to hit him below his belt.\
\
As late [Ravindra
Kumar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Kumar)used to say, "history
is futuristic". There are a lot of issues his life raises. Giving
science into the hands of the managers, even if they were like Bhabha,
has their own consequences. We have seen [Dept. of Atomic
Energy](http://www.indiatogether.org/2009/dec/rgh-atom.htm) which
interestingly is quite respected in the eyes of the mainstream media and
thus in the eyes off the general public. Once managers start controlling
an institute (for example take Times of India) it bound award the
boot-licker who fall in line. As Koshambhi once said,\

> The greatest obstacles to research in any backward, under­ developed
> country are often those needlessly created by the scientist’s or
> scholar’s fellow citizens...The meretricious ability to please the
> right people, a convincing pose, masterly charlatanism, and a clever
> press agent are indispensable for success.

He was well aware how 'financially insecure' persons (mostly students)
are exploited by 'manager-scientist' for their personal gains. You can
find out many professors who make their students work for them (without
even asking if they like it or not or would it help you becoming the
person you want to be. They may be rewarded with good reviews or
recommendation letters). He saw it as a natural phenomenon, \
\

> The Byzantine emperor Nikephoras Phokas assured himself of ample\
> notice from superficial observers, at some else’s expense, by setting
> up in his own name, at a strategic site in the Roman Forum, a column
> stolen from some grandiose temple. Many of our eminent intellectuals
> have mastered this technique. There is little point in discussing the
> personal experiences of the scum that naturally floats to the top...

\
We have 'scientific authority' in almost every way of science. Western
approval (e.g. publication in "Nature") is still considered the ultimate
test of "truth-fullness". There are stories that Bhabha made a clear
distinction between an east canteen in TIFR (where ordinary folk ate,
and which served Indian food), and a west canteen (where the scientists
ate, which served western food). He always wore western clothes, and
reportedly even went so far as to d­eemand that scientists in TIFR do
the same.\
\
Ramachandra Guha wrote about him, "Damodar Dharmanand Kosambi was a
remarkable man. Trained as a mathematician, he then went on to train
himself as a historian." After quitting his job as a Mathematician from
TIFR, says Guha, He went on "to write some pioneering works of
historical scholarship, among them A Study of Indian History and The
Culture and Civilisation of Ancient India in Historical Outline." \
\
Guha finds Kosambi as a man of a fierce and at times truculent
independence. Though his father life was more remarkable but both of
life represents quite an absorbing history and through them, may be, we
can get glimpse of Goa, India and the world.\
\
RESOURSES :\
\
1. One of the important papers which we have used here was published in 
Economic & Political Weekly,  may 16, 2009  vol xliv no 20. Indeed, this
blog has take a lot of material and resources from there and can be
easily be labelled as 'plagiarised' which this sure is.\
\
2. The Hindu newspaper has written some of the articles about him time
after time. But after they have launched a new website, the links which
google generally gives are now broken. Situation is quite helpless. :-(\
\
3. Integrating Mathematics and History: The Scholarship of D D Kosambi,
Economic and political weekly, Vol 47, No 3.\
