Languages are not an easy thing to get curious about. The first time I
got curious about languages was when I read about
*[deconstruction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconstruction)*in CAT
exam preparatory material over which my room-mate was loosing sleep.
Later it turns out that there are much more to a language than these
school of thoughts.\
\
Lets get curious about why language evolved in the first place. From the
top of  my mind, to woo a pretty girl by uttering something which does
not make sense, to gain influence in a group by saying something which
other would find *impressive,*to disseminate your ideologies. Basically
there are many benefits one can get by mastering the use of language
(You need not to be right! Ask any politician). It has been argued that
language was fabricated because early humans realised that they could
influence others for their own benefits by using it. To prove this
hypothesis they like to argue that despite of having all the tools to
built a language e.g. suffixing and prefixing a primitive sound with
another to make another meaningful sound, chimpanzees do not have any
language simply because they are not able to realize the potential
benefits of its use. According to them, basically they yet have not
realised that other have thoughts. Time is ripe for their first
*Budhha.* Bottom-line : *Realization of benefits is the mother of all
invention.*\
\
Most of the species have some sort of language - if you can define it
that way. They do not speak in long sentences, they tweets in few
distinguishable sounds (If you love tweeter means that you are catching
up with them very fast). Mostly they speak to warn others of danger
(cooperation) or to attract the other gender for reproduction  etc..
Humans have advanced capabilities in their languages. Almost all
languages posses the same fundamental structures despite of their
vastness in difference.  The use of languages is also very symmetrical.
They are generally used to influence others by various means. No wonder,
politicians are verbose, at least Indians whom we know very well. \
\
* *One of my Bengali classmate during M.Tech days at IITB was having
trouble learning Hindi. She was not able to master the use of *gender
specific terms* e.g.  जाता हैं या जाती है. She found these rules not
only hard to understand but also ridiculous. It seems that her native
language Bengali is more gender neutral than Hindi. English on the other
hand is much more gender neutral than some of the European Languages
such as Spanish, German or French. So if I tell my mom that I had dinner
with my neighbor being a native Hindi speaker she might get curious
whether my neighbor was male or female. In Hindi, I'd have used
*padosan*for female neighbor or *padosi*for male neighbor*.*In one way,
using Hindi makes us much more aware of the genders. On the other hand,
by using the word *dinner* I was able to communicate to my mother that I
had my food in late evening or in night. In Hindi, I had to express it
explicitly.\
\
There are [other more subtle
difference](http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/gender.html) among
the languages. For example [culture and civilization are
indistinguishable for a German
speaker](http://www.india-seminar.com/2010/610/610_come_gourdon.htm).
Also French do not distinguish between policy and politics. For an
English speaker, policy and politics are two different concepts. Take
another instance, when *Hindutva* forces were in power at center, they
were arguing about *secularism.*For them, as they called it, religious
pluralism which is an integral part of *Hindusim*is a kind of
secularism. On top of it, they were asking why they can not have their
own idea of secularism. Why be burdened by the western conception of it.
It is true that there is no exact equivalent of the English word
\`secular' in any Indian language. But then, the French word
*\`laique,'* which is used to describe the republic in the Constitution
of France, cannot be exactly translated into English. Obviously the idea
of the secular can be compared - or contrasted - with its counterparts
elsewhere. [[see more on this
topic](http://www.hvk.org/articles/0901/10.html)]. Sometimes idea make
sense only in one language. While an English educated Indian can take
pride in his *market oriented thinking*, for a native Hindi speaker this
could be a shameful act of being *Bazaru.*\
\
Talking of translation, languages do not translate and when one thinks
they do, one can easily come a cropper. As Tony Blair discovered when he
thought he was telling Lionel Jospin, the French socialist prime
minister, how much he envied him and his policies. What he actually said
in French was how much he lusted after him in[all his
positions](http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9588000/9588345.stm).
Admires of Ravindranath Tagore often complains how the beauty of his
Bengali verses is lost in his English translation. To some, at least to
V. S. Naipaul, Premchand turns out to be a simple story teller in his
English translation.\
\
Lets come to everyday stuff. For example, when I say, *"I am lying my
bed."* A native English speaker will simply think that *I am lying in
it*but for me being an native Hindi speaker *I am lying in her*. Because
for me, *Bed*is 'feminine'. Its not to say that I will mistake for
biological sex and confuse my bed with whatever lying in it. Some
studies have shown that people who uses gender sensitive languages may
see same thing differently. For example I may find *mountains*
beautiful, slander, and graceful since in Hindi *mountains are
feminine. *But for an [German it might contain *masculine
properties*](http://german.about.com/library/almanac/blalm_mt.htm) (der)
like strengths and ruggedness.  While an English speaker might be having
the same trouble with mountains as Parker Selfridge, the "company man"
on *Pandora*, the Chief Administrator for RDA, in movie *Avatar* was
having digesting the idea of sacred tree.\

 What he might be thinking, "*It is a god damn tree."*Now think it like
that, *"She is a god-damn tree."*\
\
One can ask here whether people who speaks gender sensitive languages
are more sensitive towards nature or things? After [1967 essay of Lynn
white](http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1969/JASA6-69White.html), we have
been told repeatedly that Indians are the first in the world to enact
laws to protect animals and forests. It's another story altogether why
these views were not current before 1967!\
  \
Anthropologists were of the opinion that there are few concepts which
are common to all languages, no matter how primitive. It came as a shock
to know that natural numbers are totally absent from a tribal language
called [Piraha](http://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/piraha/803). They
do not have words like of one, two, three. They use *Hoi, hoii,
hooiii*sounds to represent one, few and many. Another surprising fact,
thought less shocking, is [Guugu
Yimithirr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guugu_Yimithirr_language), ask
them their address and they will not use the words Left and Right. They
somehow have built a compass in their head. They will tell you that from
here go North that much and then East that much and then so on and so
forth. When some of them made to  watch a movie on T.V., they do not say
that he is coming towards them instead they used directions. If the
screen is facing North, he will say that this person is going North. Now
consider taking dance training classes in this language. How would you
respond if your instructor asks you to bend you north leg eastward and
rotate it to south?\
\
This effect may vary geographically also in one language. My experience
is that people from Villages use more words related with direction
rather than using left  &  right. The reason could be that they have
more open spaces and it make sense by remembering the direction rather
than landmarks. In Mumbai, I can tell people to go left from IITB main
gate. In cities I may not be able to make out which is North and South
if I am not train well. In jungle, It is better to rely on direction and
trace your path exactly in same way rather than making some landmarks.\
\
**DOES IT CHANGES SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL\
**\

> **\
> The Irish had no word for 'no', The Roman none for 'yes'. Which

One can ask whether using a language make us handicap while its come to
think of some idea? In 1940, [Benjamin Lee
Worf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Lee_Whorf) published an
essay which started this school of thought that language make us what we
think. His views were as popular as *The Selfish Gene* or *The Clash of
Civilization* have been. All of these theories are now widely discarded,
at least in academic circles.\
\
Take Sanskrit, it has not only singular and plural, but also have dual;
probably to emphasize relations which are dual in nature such as husband
and wife, son and mother, daughter and father, friends.  Does it mean
that speaker of Sanskrit are more conscious about relations which are
dual in nature. In Sanskrit what in English means *They went away*could
as well mean *Both of them went away.*And if one say in English *We were
home that day*. Can we expect that a Sanskrit speaker to be curious
whether *'we*were' two or many?\
\
The experts are still far away from concluding anything concrete whether
there is something fundamental which one can not understand using one
language. Though as we have seen there are some benefits one language
provides over other language.\

**BILINGUALISM IN INDIA \

-- M. K. Gandhi\
\

Once an Indian anthropologists told a Cambridge academics seated next to
him over dinner hosted by an Japanese anthropologist that he did not
think British to be particularly civilised. On which his British friend
took the banter and challenged him to define a civilised person. He took
the challenged and said that for him a 'civilised person is simply a
person who is at home in at least two different languages: having one
language makes us human and being at home in more than one is what makes
us civilised.'  Prof. Chie Nakane who has been listening to the
interchange with amusement turned to Indian and said, "*Ah! That a very
Indian way of looking at civilisaztion.*"*[3]*One could only guess
the**embarrassed our co-patriot have been through since Japanese are, if
anything, are more inept that British at any other language that their
own.\
\
\
Indians have always been at ease with languages, at least in its spoken
forms. At the time of Independence, till 1970's, almost all of our
Scholars were emotionally bilingual.  They were as active in English as
they were in their native languages. They were not only functionally
active, they were able to feel and think in other language. Even while
Gandhi was criticizing English language, He was following the path of
others who used English as a medium to make his views known to the other
world. So if he wrote his book in Gujrati, he also made sure by
translating them in English that his books reaches a wider audience.\
\
In fact, he was just following in the footsteps of others. Rammohan roy
published his essays in Persian and Begali before he came to write in
English. As for Tagore who shaped and reshaped Bangla literature by his
writings wrote extensively in English. His major non-fiction work
*Nationalism* was written in English. Nothing can be more striking than
the fact that the very archetype of modern Hindi novel *Godan* was first
outlined in English by *Premchand*. Although he never wrote anything in
English.\
\
This rise and decline of Bilingualism in India is discussed by
Ramachandra Guha in [2]. There have been a very lively debate over it
and can be found in later issues of EPW.  In his essay, he concludes
that, "*The decline of the bilingual intellectual in contemporary India
is thus a product of a combination of many factors: public policy –
which emphasised the mother tongue alone; elite preference – which
d­enied or diminished the mother tongue altogether; social change – as
in new patterns of marriage* (If a Bengali and Tamil got married, their
children mother tongue will be English!)*; and economic change – as in
the material gains to be had from a command of English.*\
\
“*There are some things*”, says the protagonist [Balram
Halwai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Tiger) of the novel *The
White Tiger*[1], “*that can only be said in English*”. Sometimes one
language offers privileged access to un-mined territories which others
can not. The influence of English has in-fact enriched the quality of
arguments in native languages even if the arguments are often
subservient of combative. The major literary figures of 19th century who
commanded English language did not hesitate to experiment with the new
literary forms in their own languages. \
\
It is often said that difference of language divide people all over.
These arguments have been made first in Europe which has been divided on
the lines of languages. India has been divided into states on the lines
of the languages and such demand have not stopped in present also. The
question of language has been a major factor in the early days of
nationalist movements **and the arrogance of Hindiwallah provoked Muslim
League to consider the idea of Pakistan [For instance, see *Hindi
nationalism, Alok Rai*]. We often see, and many of us as witnessed it,
the politics of language created hostility to other languages in the
name of loyalty and attachment to the mother tongue.\
\
Politics is often used to deepen the gap between people or create the
bridge across them. It would be worthwhile to keep in mind that loyalty
of Indians is not necessarily singular since an Indian is usually
attached with more than one languages, if not by a direct contact than
at least though music and movies. This has been a practise in the past
an their in no signs that such a practise will not become more extensive
in future. \
\
\
At least the educated Indians are rapidly giving away this advantage of
having grip over languages. [Europeans are slowly realizing the
potential of learning other
languages](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/aug/30/learning-languages-still-matters).
If the old Bhasabalahs banned English on the school, our English
educated elites are much more averse to their own native languages -
their mother tongue. Learning a different languages may not make us
think fundamentally different. It probably will be of no worth in
language-agnostic professions of Engineering and Mathematics but as for
Gandhi, and for Tagore, '**the foreign language was a window into
another culture, another civilisation, another way (or ways) of living
in the world.'**For them**'the command of a language other than their
own was a way of simultaneously making perspective themselves less
parochial and their work more universal. Their readings and  travels fed
back into their own writing, thus bringing the world to Bengal and
Gujarat, and'** (when they chose to wrote in the foreign
language)**'Bengal and Gujarat to the world. Bilingualism was here a
vehicle or something larger and more enduring namely,
multiculturalism'**.[2]\
