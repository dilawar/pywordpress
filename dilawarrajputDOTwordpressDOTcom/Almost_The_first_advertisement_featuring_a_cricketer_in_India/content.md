From : Back page of 'Bombay Pentangular', S. K. Roy (1945) featuring C.
K. Rayudu - India's first great cricketer.

> Major C.K. Nayudu, once again, as on the first day of the match, was
> the idol of the huge crowd. Whether ‘C.K.’ played a ball, sent down a
> delivery or did some fielding, everything was cheered. Going out after
> tea on Sunday, he was literally mobbed by youthful admirers, each
> wanting to tap their hero on the back. Evidently they forgot that the
> Major’s broad shoulders carried a covering of human flesh and there
> was a limit to slaps of appreciation. When stumps were drawn, Nayudu
> had to run to the Club House to avoid being shouldered. The crowd was
> not to be outdone fully and they refused to disperse unless Nayudu
> came out. The Major had to appear three times on the Club House top
> dock before the thousands, who called for ‘Nayudu’, decided to tread
> their way back.
