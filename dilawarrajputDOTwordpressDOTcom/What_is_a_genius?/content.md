'What exactly is a genius' is a very hard question to answer. Hard still
is answering 'who is perceived to be a genius'.[[ To do : The idea of
natural inequality ]] We often see a 'genius' as a gifted person,
endowed by nature her supreme gift - intelligence. Many, however,
believe that 'practise makes a man perfect'. They argue that a person
can be made 'genius' by giving him enough time to grow with a suitable
training and education. Confucius said once, '***A donkey goes on
travelling, it does not come back as horse.'***implying that it is not
neccessay that a man can be changed much simply because his later
education or training has been improved. It is very hard to change
'pattern of minds' of individuals. Different patterns of mind are
cultivated in different environment one grows in and are strengthened or
weakened by the company one keeps. But the question is, is it true that
nature sometimes really gift people at birth which can not be developed
in one's lifetime by training? It is worthy to note that what Adam Smith
said in his book, "**.. the very different genius which appears to
distinguish men of different professions, when grown up to maturity, is
not upon many occasions so much the cause, as the effect of division of
labour. The difference between the most dissimilar characters, between a
philosopher and a common street porters, for example, seems to arise not
so much of nature, as from habit, custom, and education'. -**The wealth
of nations, Chicago Univ press, 1967, p19. There have been many
stimulating discussions on 'what makes a genius' in last century mostly
by biologists, economist and anthropologists. Biology has  contributed
immensely to the folk belief about natural inequality. What is 
interesting about this biology is the extent to which, in dealing with
the question of human nature, it took for granted the categories of the
society of which it was a product (See, M. Sahlins, *The use and abuse
of Biology, 1977)*. Among others  who supported these ideas was T. H.
Huxley who carried his weight of  reputation as one of the Britain's
leading scientists. He attacked Rosseau for  being both inconsistent and
disingenuous. He was not at all warm to the idea of  equality.
**"Equality was sanctioned neither by science not by philosophy; even
the equality sanctioned by great religions, Judaism and  Christianity,
was a residual kind, 'an equality either of insignificance or of
imperfection.' (***On the natural inequality of men, Jan 1890,)*Echoes
of his words can be found in many contemporary writers. Sir Francis
Galton who in 19th century '*laid the groundwork for studies which
examines the relationship between biological hereditary and social
achievement was greatly struck by the unequal achievements of the
individuals in various walks of life, and sought to prove that much of
this was due to hereditary*'. Galton was successful because he did not
even try to overcome the presupposition in his framework of analysis.
(*See, hereditary genius) "**There can hardly be a surer evidence of the
enormous differences between the intellectual capacity of men, than the
prodigous difference between in the number of marks obtained by those
who gain mathematical honours in Cambridge."***For technical reason,
later, he accepted the success in mathematical tripos as evidence of
superior natural abilities. He, however, did not pause to consider that
men and women have to be certified as naturally unequal because
examination system guarantees their unequal success, and examination
system is what it is because a larger society requires it to be so. On
this point, **Prof. E. Leach** suggested,

> **If society insists that individual be segregated out into categories
> - first class, second class, third class, uper, middle, lower - the
> system will always have to waste an enormous amount of time and energy
> allocating individuals to the right slots and marking them with up
> proper labels.**

Though one sympathise with Prof Leach, its hard to see how a modern
institute can work with doing away such a labelling. However, in his
perspective, it stands out that inequality are an artefact of social
inequality. Its only in the 20th century when these ideas of natural
inequality, merit, talent or abilty were chased with a seriousness it
deserves. It is difficult not to be impressed by the inputs that have
gone into measuring intelligence in this century with US leading the
way. It is doubtful that any other human quality has been measured so
extensively and implicit in much of such labour is the belief that
intelligence is a gift of nature, perhaps her most supreme gifts.

Some have argued that anything valuable in this world is hardly
measurable. What makes intelligence particularity appropriate as a
quality by which individuals can be ranked? How one justify the belief
that intelligence as a whole can be measured? **Now we have come to a
point where experts know more about measuring intelligence than about
what intelligence is?**To put it in the words of Arthur Jenson
'***Intelligence, like electricity, is easier to measure than to
define."** (How much can we boost IQ and scholastic achievement?, A R
Jenson, p5)* In our time, abilities and achievements are closely linked
together. And the ability is reckoned not in the abstract, but in some
standard of achievement. These standards have their locus-path in
various institutes through which a individual collects certificates for
one's ability. Its hard these days that someone which superior abilities
will go unnoticed. The fact that there are so little super-genius these
days is due to the fact that we are producing too many of them. Although
people say these days no new basic contribution is being made. It could
be due to the fact that most of the subjects have matured and one has to
spend much more time getting accustomed to one's chosen field. At best,
contribution can only be incremental, even if substantial. There are may
who has not contributed anything very fundamental like of Newton, Guass
etc to their chosen subject but they are genius nonetheless, Terence
Tao, Donald E Knuth, N. Karmarkar etc are some good example. -- Dilawar
