In media, especially Western, there has been a lot of talk about
gender-discrimination in India. Some report claims that [India is one of
the most dangerous place for women to
live](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/15/worst-place-women-afghanistan-india)
due to various reasons. These reasons, both prominent and sundry -
although visible in almost every sphere of public life - manifest
themselves in most cruel ways as female-foeticide and rape.\
\
What do they mean by 'dangerous' is not at all explained. Is it
premature death by unnatural causes? Given the life expectancy of Indian
females, surely it does not qualify for one of the most dangerous place
on the planet. If female foeticide is\
one of the main reason, then why does some of the Western countries do
not figure in the list where[abortion
rate](http://www.abortionno.org/Resources/fastfacts.html) is as high as
20% - slightly more than half of them surely will be females. And what
about on per capita basis? Female foeticide proves that there is an
alarming bias against girl child in India but it does not prove that
there is an alarming sense of feudalism for women for bias against
unborn child is not the same thing as the bias against a living human.\
\
If by 'dangerous', they mean domestic violence then there is an element
of truth in the report. There might have been some exaggeration. It is a
common habit among journalists to lobby for some cause and they usually
believe that its ok to stretch the point somewhat if it serves a good
cause. This behaviour become more prominent in reports written by
social-activists.\
\
Ideally, a student of society is not suppose to talk, write and think
passionately, for passion is only a thin veil for lack of argument. But
its hard to remain aloof when you see that something is wrongly written
and would be perceived distorted.\
\
I, as a student of society, can say the work of the journalists are not
very helpful in analysing a society for journalists do not spend much
time reading the past of a society and trajectory of its growth. But the
comments they pass look like a comment on a whole culture and nation
rather than the cause and effect of an issue in a given timeline. This
sure is misleading specially to those who do not have first hand
experience of particular culture. \
\
India was perhaps the most hierarchical society (Ref : Homo Hierarchicus
by Louis Dumont) in the past and continue to do so in present. The
discrimination based on gender and caste is still very much real.
[Modernity is still a new phenomenon in
India](http://dilawarsays.blogspot.com/2011/05/modernity-and-indian-society.html)
and has not touched all corners of it, given the limited reach of
communication and literacy among women and men in rural areas. Beside
modernity in India is a skewed concept. To many, it means negation of
traditions.\
\
\
The good thing is that there is empowerment of women though its reach
and pace is rather limited. Nothing could be more revealing than the
fact that in the electrical department of IIT Bombay, one of the most
modern segment of the society, we have only two female professors -- a
ratio much smaller than the ratio of female and male students. It is
hard to agree that we did not receive applications from worthy female
candidates since at EE - IIT Madras, there are many female professors.
What is more distressing that we do not seek out female candidates. If
this medieval ratio is present in the community of professors, what
would one infer about the normal section? \
\
\
We do not treat our women like Sweden and Norway but we are not going
backwards. After all, 4 chief ministers of India are females. They got
support from their male patron in their early political career but they
reached to the zenith by themselves. Mayawati and Mamta Banerjee are two
extreme cases of female agency in a largely male dominant profession.
Given the level hostility against them in media, their achievements
rather become more impressive. There are channels, even in the most
traditional part of the society, for women to grow. However these
channels are only available to those who already have a backing from
their families or a patron. \
\
Wars may have been a major factor in degradation of status of women
especially in Northern part of India. When war occurs, women becomes the
first victim. In India, since a lot of feudal culture lived together,
women mobility was restricted - presumably for their safety. We have
seen outsiders as conqueror and warriors. It has stopped the economic
development and also reduced that trust among people. Also most of the
feudal castes and clans, which British used to call martial races,
resides in these areas. These martial races, has been low on education
and modern-ideas. [They have many medieval customs which are still
practiced.](http://beta.epw.in/newsItem/comment/190130/)\
\
The warrior heroes on these lands in those times were mostly Rajputs
(when Muslim invaded) and Mughals (when British grew in their influence)
and they had the custom to put their women behind the purdah. Though
they were known to treat their women with utmost pride and dignity were
their mobility was restricted and they were not allowed to be educated.
Many other groups took clues from their hero's and started treating
their women in such a ways. My own grandmother is illiterate and my
mother could not continue education after 5th grade since her father was
not in favour of it. Now the same village boasts 5 female graduates and
arts and sciences. True, that their education is not world class but one
should be blind to ignore the change in last 50 years. \
\
\
There still are many who believes that a book called 'Smriti' and
'Shashtras' written by
[Manu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manusm%E1%B9%9Bti) some 2500 years
ago should be considered 'the laws'. These laws have some of the most
derogatory remarks about women and lower castes. The basic idea was
pollution. Since most of the lower caste people assigned work which was
considered 'polluted' such as tanning, farming and cleaning the roads,
their touch was avoided by higher caste Indians for not to get polluted.
Women were considered polluted during their periods.\
\
A modern day city dwelling Indian would not even able to understand the
idea of pollution. But influence of these laws has left strong habits in
their consciousness. One of influence of these laws are non-secular
categorisation of work. Indians still love to grade works they do.
Unlike Japanese, we have only respect of well-born and well to do, and
there is no respect for useful work. Since most of the useful work is
polluting in one sense or another. This scorn for these kind of work is
best visible in our restaurant. Indian never say 'thank you' to a waiter
or waitress in restaurant. \
\
\
Going back in time, In one of the oldest epic, Mahabharta, it seems that
women has much more freedom than most of the modern societies do provide
even in these days. Women Chastity was an elastic concept. A women was
free, despite of being married, to seek sex with some notable warrior or
a learned man for a child. In same ways, it was *dharma*(duty) for a
warrior to accept a women if she approached him for a son and not for
pleasure. Manu was not born only few centuries later than Mahabharta was
written. This shows that society sometimes changes rapidly in time-span
of few centuries. At the present juncture, India does not look
impressive when it come to women life. (Ref: Yuganta, Irawati Karve)\
\
To add to these random facts, one major factor has been the 'mode of
production'. Northern states are wheat producing states while southern
states are rice producing states. In cultivation of rice, everything is
done by hand and the labour of women become much more important. Thus
the role of a women is of a co-worker rather than a dependent. When a
woman become shareholder in work, she is respected. If a women is not
allowed to or can not make a living, what options she have if treated
with violence? She has to suffer quietly. Even among villages and towns
where women mobility is restricted, adult girls prefer to work if a
chance is provided.\
\
An interesting fact, put forward by D D Kosambi, is that in Travencore
area plough was invented or discovered very late and agriculture
remained in hands of women. Since tilling with plough would have
required cattle power and muscle power, it would have transferred
control of land from the women to men. Men were mostly in the business
of hunting. Where plough was invented early, men got into agriculture
for they were in charge of controlling wild animals. With hunting
becoming secondary occupation, there is no wonder that men took the
control of land from women in these 'advance' society. In Travencore
area, such as Kerala, the society is still matriarchal.\
\
Muslim rule in India has also contributed to degradation of women. But
it would be wrong to say that they created these patterns of mind. They
only strengthen those patterns. Manu was well established before Muslim
established themselves here. Most of Indian Muslims were converted and
conversion to another religion does not change habits and pattern of
mind.\
\
These behaviour of misogamy are not going to go away easily since people
who are moving into middle class are from small cities and town where
traditional misogamy is much more deeply rooted. One can easily hears
mockery and derogatory comments about girls in college campuses. Women
in our society grows up to be meek, afraid and insecure. Fortunately,
many families sure has moved ahead on roads of female empowerment due to
reasons ideological and material. Also, a rising secularism of work,
especially in IT and others, have given a segment of women much more
monetary power. Time will tell how they are going to use it?\
\
One exception in India is state of Kerala which despite of having very
low per capita income has Human development Index comparable to first
world country. It has a fertility rate at replacement level, India's
lowest birthrate, lowest infant mortality, highest age of marriage and
longest lifespan. Furthermore, Kerala's literacy rate is over 94%. The
major difference between Kerala and rest of the India that here society
is matriarchal.\
\
And for these tendency of ranking, comparing societies generally leads
to fruitful outcomes. But to compare for the sake of 'holier than thou'
or for ranking purpose is not only simplistic but also irritating.\

END NOTES :\
\
[1] See 'Men and Women' - Amartya Sen\
\
[2] NyTimes have been more rational about reporting women in India. \
\
[3] From the point of view of Social Anthropology, these honor killing
does not imply that women are treated with dignity in these societies.
They give much more protection to their women. But they are not that
much forgivable should a women cross the limits of their custom. These
custom may look ridiculous to outsiders.\
\
[4] The gap in North and South Indian is really revealing. There is very
low chance that a woman will be manhandles in bus or train in southern
city say Chennai than in northern city like Delhi. In fact, [Delhi looks
like a culture-less city with its reasons in
history](http://dilawarsays.blogspot.com/2010/08/reflection-on-delhi.html).
After 1857, this city was destroyed by British (you guys would never
escape :-p) to teach a lesson for uprising. The great families of
Shahajahanabad was thrown out and merchant, traders and like wise people
were forced to move in. Since then, it could not create a identity of
its own.\
\
[5] Female foeticide and domestic violence in India is really very high.
And it is not restricted to some classes or castes. All of India suffer
from it. Its terrible. But these do not restrict women agency
all-together.
