It feels odd being a sociologist. We compare and contrast, most of the
time if not always. I don't want to compare Dravid with anyone else but
temptation to compare is not easy to give up. Let me just say this:
while Tendulkar is worshiped, [Dravid is
admired](http://www.quora.com/Rahul-Dravid/What-are-some-iconic-quotes-about-Rahul-Dravid).
His admires are not just his peer thought that is enough a proof of his
abilities and capabilities; he has his admirers in no less than
Historian Ramchandra Guha.
