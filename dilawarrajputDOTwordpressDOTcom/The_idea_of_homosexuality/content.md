Once, during my post graduation, I did an unusual thing. I was not
walking alone. I was going from my Hostel 9 to Char-2 lab with two more
guys. On the course of our voyage, we were intercepted by a bunch of
girls. As usual, one of us started staring at someone among them.
Someone among us remarked, "*Dekh salla kaise ghoor raha hai.*" (Look!
How is he staring at her.). At this, I told him, "*Ghoorega to sochegi
ki 'perverse' hai, nahi dekhega to sochegi ki 'gay' hai.*" (She might
think that he is perverse if he stares, otherwise she will think he is
gay). Guys found it very amusing.\
\
Once I and Robin went to Lake-side having our hands on each other
shoulders. Many people looked at us and there were definite smiles on
their faces. I told Robin that public is taking a wrong view about us.
One of my lab-mate once told me that she passes remark of homosexuality
whenever she sees two girls walking together holding hands. I myself
never missed the chance passing the comment of "So cute!" whenever I saw
Gaurav and His friend taking a stroll.\
\
At another time, one of classmate was asking me if I have seen Health
Minister of India in news so much. Those days, our health minister was
trying to legalize homosexuality in India. \
\
Then there was poster hanging in front of SOM inviting everyone to take
part in the debate about homosexuality at the same time when I was busy
making poster about my project work. That indeed is a curious case.
Meanwhile, my all time[favorite magazine](http://www.littlemag.com/)came
out with "Sex Determination".\
\
Homosexuality! The most popular definition of homosexuality deals with
penetrative sex. Many of cases which came out in public; from Alan
Turing to Elton John  globally,  all of them involved the idea of
'penetrative sex'. The case has been so if it is between man, and an
approval of men that this indeed is a case of queer if it is between
women . The non-English India, which in 97% of it, has a different take
on homosexuality. They simply do not like to discuss it in these terms.
Taking about homosexuality in public is a prerogative of anglo-phonic
Indians. Among college students, this is a widely talked about topic.
However, there is a confusion about what exactly is a homosexual
behavior. When I was an undergraduate student, one of my room mate was
wondering, "*Yaar, in case of a boy there is a real sex, kind of
penetration...but in case of girls .. ummm.. there is no real sex..*"
Then he became thoughtful to an unusual degree. Later he relieved
himself by playing Pocket Tanks.\
\
Next day I told my room-mates a joke. Once Santa proposed to a girl and
she said, "No, I am lesbian." Santa asked, "What is a lesbian?" "I like
to have sex with girls." At this Santa replied, "Wow! Then I am also a
lesbian." Oh! Gaonwala (The Villager) is cracking sophisticated jokes.
They replied. Somehow, they believe that debating or talking about
homosexuality is a sign of sophistication if not of modernity.\
\
Madhuri Dixit was perhaps the first female superstar of India rose to
prominence with some path breaking female-centered role.e.g. *Ansso Bane
Angare (*Tears turns into Fire), *Anjaam,*Mratyudand etc. One of the
most controversial song, "*Choli ke peeche kya hai"(*What is behind the
blouse?)**definite has a queer element in it. About this song my Hindi
teacher in High-School would say, "*Bhai*, if you see it in other
prospective, Then 'Choli ke peeche' is mother-milk also." But one of us
was not convinced. He went to argue with the teacher that this indeed
was an assault on our culture. He did not say it in sophisticated way.
The language he used is what *Bajrang Dal* or *Shri Ram Sene* would use.
Anyway none of them see it any sort of homosexuality there. There was no
doubt a queer element in it and this queer element was high-lightened by
a singer voice which , though of female, but very husky as to inhibit a
male element. And if you have seen the dance steps in this song, there
is nothing that'd quell your doubts about it.\
\
Majority of Indians still alien from the idea of homosexuality. Perhaps
the most funny scene about the perception of female-homosexuality is in
the movie, 'Bend it like Beckham'. When Juliet's mother was hysterical
and throws the word 'lesbian' in accusation at Parminder during a family
wedding, an elderly aunt says, "*Lesbian? But she is born in march. I
though she is Piscean.*" Another adds, "*She is not Lebanese, she's
Punjabi.*" The idea of lesbian is very remote from center-stage of
Indian mass culture. I am pretty sure many Indian will confuse
themselves about the behavior of 'Kantaben' from 'Kal Ho Na Ho".\
\
The place where I was born, Nichalpur, a typical Indian Village, has no
conception of homosexuality. Though there may have been some cases found
out but never been talked in public, not even in gossips. A nearby town,
Seohara, where I did my schooling, is quite different.  Cities and
villages are better than towns of India in handling their sexuality.
Once I went to visit one of my friend at his home and He advised me not
to come that early or that late. Since I was just five feet tall and was
girl-like in composure, too young to be in 12th standard. He told me
without much fuss, " *Ye Budhdha log, Sallo se khada hua nahi jaata par
gand marne pahle chal dete hai."* (These old guys, they can not walk
properly but will be the first one to sodomize you.) I never visited him
at his place again. Again, once when I was having a hair cut at a
saloon, the barber - Indian barbers are famous for telling a lot of
stories - obviously jealous of one of his *chela*who left him and went
to Dubai and become rich was telling one of the many present in his
shop, "*Bhai woh [people in Dubai] log peeche ke shaukin hote hai. Paisa
to isne kamaya hai par ab ye insaan nahi raha."* (In Dubai, those guys
are fond of back-side, He, no doubt made money, is no longer a man.").\
\
Another place in my life which is is left here are the books which I am
very fond of reading. Since my childhood I never spared any book I could
get my hands on. The best time I spend in my life was in IIT-B library,
founding the oldest books available and leaving my signature somewhere
in the book was something I really loved to do. But before that, I used
to buy and borrow a lot of books in Hindi  whenever I traveled from
Nichalpur to Chennai. The journey took almost 2 full days and in two
days I would savor Premchand, Jaishankar Prasad, Phanishwar Das Renu,
Dinker, Mahadevi Verma, Translation of Tagore, Maxim Gorky, Tolstoy.
Hindi literature (at least the one I read) never discussed sexuality
openly. Only Gandhi has the guts to say such things openly. The first
story I've ever read about homosexuality was
'[Lihaaf](http://media.opencultures.net/queer/data/indian/Lihaaf_or_The_Quilt.htm)'
(the quilt)  by  late Ishamt Chaugati. Nothing of the exposure to this
world I ever got through reading fiction prepared me for this. Later
there was an overdose of *Steven Stifler* ( from *American Pie* ). For
next few days I would comment, "Potential lesbians on the road!" or
"Potential lesbians alighting bus." One of my room mate would wonder,
"Are you getting sex addict."\
\
This much of my journey in life cutting across the various facets of
India tells me that 'homosexuality' still has a long way to go.
Personally, I am not very much approved of it. Some ideas, no matter how
rational, are hard to digest. Just like the idea of 'spending 100 rupees
on a cup of tea' is not as digestible as 'spending 100 rupees on a cup
of coffee'. Our culture shapes our predispositions. Few alien ideas, no
matter how much they have been around you, are too strange to digest.
Aren't they?\
\
To be sure, the idea of homosexuality is itself borrowed from a
different culture. Kamasutra might have something of it. In Western
culture, as far as I can tell from my experience by watching their
movies, they find it easy to label anyone as homosexual if he does not
ogle over different sex. This paragraph [in a news
report](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article1597266.ece)is
reveals the cultural blindness of accuser.\

>  Mr. Lelyveld adds: “One respected Gandhi scholar characterised the
> relationship as ‘clearly homoerotic' rather than homosexual, intending
> through that choice of words to describe a strong mutual attraction,
> nothing more. The conclusions passed on by word of mouth by South
> Africa's small Indian community were sometimes less nuanced. It was no
> secret then, or later, that Gandhi, leaving his wife behind, had gone
> to live with a man.”

Perhaps such insinuation are easy for someone from a culture which has
produced and in turn influenced by Freud.\
\
There are many instances in one of their most popular t.v. show
'Friends'  where characters were identified as homosexual if they did
not stare at women breasts. This is not to say that every one in the
Western world thinks a man is homosexual if he fails to stare at the
breast of a passing by woman. Popular culture such as cinema, arts,
literature etc. do create elements in a culture which are different than
that of mass culture. On our campus, one can see young girls and boys
walking together holding hands. While an older Indian might see it as a
sign of innocent friendship, some one into which a fair amount of
Western culture has seeped would not mind labellings them homosexual,
perhaps light-heartedly.\
\
Gandhi has been labeled homosexual because some of his letters contained
words like 'love', 'desire' etc. I am not sure how would they react to
the movie, '[Anand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anand_%28film%29)' in
which an cancer patient dying in the arms of a man - first his doctor-
who loved him. Or in the movie 'Sholey' when Jai was talking to *Mausi* 
about  *Veeru* for *Basanti*and deliberatly telling her about his
character in a very funny way could be interpreted as act of protecting
his friendship from hetro-sexual intrusion. \

These days many women find it easy to believe that males do not bond.
They just spend time with each other. Such views are backed by the facts
that display of intensity of their bond is minimal. A Male bonds with
another male over some shared interest.  In old days, it was hunting and
bonding was a necessity. It is now a round of golf, a game of cricket, a
pub-crawl, a drink at a bar, watching a Formula 1 race and so on. I
perhaps do not any men bonding over a long telephone call, a walk,
shopping for clothes, over a cup of coffee at each others' homes and so
on. It's almost as if the activity is needed to legitimise the bond. In
old Indian movies, a male friend was often seen as sacrificing something
of great value for his male friend, usually love of his life or his life
itself. A woman, however, only sacrificed for her man. This contrast in
movies should not be overemphasized but their existence can not be
denied. Women bonds with each other and then they find some common
interest. To put it in Vijay Nagaswamy words :\

> Men are, in fact, far more tolerant of their friends' irrationalities
> than they are of those of their wife and children and I have known
> this phenomenon to cause serious marital disharmony. Also, they seem
> to tolerate each others' boundary violations better, sometimes to
> incomprehensible extents. One reason for this is that men are able to
> relate to each others' foibles with greater empathy and when they
> forgive or tolerate a friend's imperfections, they are actually
> vicariously forgiving and tolerating their own. However, they may not
> give their women friends the same leeway.

\
In such a scenario, it is safe to assume that  a homosexual male do not
become homosexual for sex.  There is something deeper psychologically
which makes a man homosexual. Some of the better known homosexual are
very creative people and are not known to be of experimenting perverts
type. Perhaps, decline of interest in woman among the top strata of male
society has also contributed to this. Besides there is a huge mistrust
among males and females these days. Such statements of mistrust are
vividly depicted on televisions. Indeed, [many men are loosing interest
in sex
altogether](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/dec/27/japan-men-sexless-love?INTCMP=SRCH).
Why? [Theories
abound](http://www.adbusters.org/magazine/86/private-worlds.html). This
is not very unnatural. There are many people who do not show much
enthusiasm for breeding even though they are claim to be interested in
sex. Sex is only evolved for breeding. So if the case for the primary
cause has gone down, sooner of later it surely will terminate the
desire. No wonder many males are turning homosexual. They are not much
interested in sex but being homosexual gives them a partner which whom
they can share a common interest.\
