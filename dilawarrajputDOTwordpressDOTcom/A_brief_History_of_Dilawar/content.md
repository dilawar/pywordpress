\
My ancestor were so happy living in Iran.
[Avestan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avestan_language) was their
mother tounge. It was written right to left and have a strong emphasis
on minute phonological differences.\
\
One day I dont know what happened, a group of dissidents broke away.
They were literally pissed off. Why? Hard to say. May be because they
were dissidents and did not like others hushing them up. Or may be, they
were just pissed off. They decided that they must leave and start their
own. It could well had been a case of 'get lost you ass\*\*\*\*\*\*".
But whatever was the case, they did not like the *status-quo.*\
\
So they took their horses and came to settle in North India. They called
themselves '[aryan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arya)' which was
derived from Avestan. They may have killed and displaced a large number
of '[dravidian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravidians)' over there who
were the native of this land. Dravidians now live in South India and are
proud of their longest surviving 'culture' despite of this colossal
plundering. My ancestors must have been a ruthless tribe when it came to
its own benefits. A characteristics which we still posses. Aryans, as
they called themselves were fond of horses. In fact, old Indus-Valley
civilisation never knew of horses. [All of they knew were bulls and
cows](http://www.thehindu.com/fline/fl1720/17200040.htm).\
\
So pissed of my ancesstors was with their Aventan brothers that they
came up their own language and gave it name 'Sanskrit' (the perfect
one). They must have liked to make things perfect. I like that. They did
not like to write the way their Avestan brothers did. They wrote  left
to right. In addition, I don't know why, they did not like the sound of
'h'. They replace 'h' with 's'. So *Hapta-Hindu* became *Sapta-Sindhu*,
*Ahura* is now *Asura, Harxvati* is *Sarasvati* and so on. But this did
not stop here, often the meaning of gods were also reserved, . Not
surprisingly, *Ahura* were gods in *Avestan*, *Asura* is the demon in
Sanskrit. *Indira* is king of god for the Sanskrit, He was demon for the
Avestan. Seriously something really bad must have happened among them..
[In fact, the oldest Avestan is so similar to the oldest Sanskrit that
you can translate text in one language to another by applying few
phonological changes](http://www.ancientscripts.com/avestan.html). Like
so:\
\
Blue is Avestan, Black is Sanskrit. The ə symbol represents the mid
central vowel (schwa) like the "e"s in "taken". First line is Aventan,
second is in Sanskrit.\
\
təm amavantəm yazatəm
tam amavantam yajatam\
\
surəm damohu scvistəm
suram dhamasu savistham\
\
miθrəm yazai zaoθrabyo
mitram yajai hotrabhyah\
\
Initially, 'arya' meant 'to till'. This was considered a noble
profession. This, still, is considered noble. I myself is a son of
farmer. [Then  they decided that there should be the the division of
labour and came out with
caste-system](http://books.google.co.in/books?id=XsOtRGdvIigC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&q=&f=false).
Arya in this age came to mean 'the noble', why? Elites were not in
'agriculture' so they came up with this meaning to reclaim this title.
So few of my ancestor became Noble, and the person who did farming is
considered *Mlichcha*(the lower one, not-pure). The Sanskrit was refined
in this period and the best grammar in the world was written by
[Panini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini). A new
language was evolved which is called
*[Prakri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prakrit)t*. *Prakrit* was spoken
by the masses and *Sanskrit* was reserved as the language of learning, a
prerogatives of elites - the brahmos (Brahmins). Pratrik was considered
a language of *Malichcha (*the lower ones). In fact, even in these days,
Sanskrit is replaced by English in letter and spirit. The language which
evolved from *Prakrit* (e.g. Hindi and its relatives) is now spokes by
masses and considered the language of *Malichcha*by English-speaking
elites (never mind the lip-services - which largely comes from the
slight embarrassment for not being able to honour their mother-tongue.
Its better to call it native-tongue so the embarrassment will be less.
The word 'mother' has  morality related to it also.). In few years,
their literature could be found in museum with the tag, "Look, your
ancestor used to read this.".\
\
My ancestor was very curious about universe. Their whole knowledge was
centered around the universe. Astrology and Mathematics were
intertwined. Whatever they knew, they put it in 'Vedas' which literally
meant 'to know'. This was their science. I am so proud of them. It was a
pleasing a incident and they met with us (peacefully, first and last
time) these days and learned mathematics from us. The westerns learned
it from them and hence the foundation of mathematics were laid. The
decimal number system discovered here and spread throughout the world.
The world now know that decimal system was invented in India due to
generous references given by Muslim scholars in their writings. When
'Vedas' came to end, we called it Vedanta, 'The end of knowing'. Why
would they do that? I can not say! Perhaps they stopped appreciating the
changes. Perhaps that was the worst thing to happen in our life.\
\
Since then my ancestor lost sight which way they are going. Hinduism was
never been a religion, it was considered a way of life. Now its been
downgraded to a religion and people fight over it everyday almost all
the time - in fact there was a time in which the most narrowed version
of Hinduism (Hindutva) came to fore. Perhaps the strongest quality of
Hinduism lies in its chaotic nature for allowing every kind of infusion
into it, that is why it survived (to quote [Ashish
Nandy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashis_Nandy)).\
\
Being in a rich and fertile land is not easy. Lot of people vie for it.
Han Chinese attacked these lands. Few stayed, married here and settled
down in the areas now [called Haryanam, Punjab and near
by](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Scythian) places. Few of them are
known as *[Jats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jat_people)*. Alexander
came to India and few of his soldiers stayed here. They married the
local princess. [They now belong to a much wider idea of
'Rajputs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_Rajputs)'. A clan of
them in known as [Chauhans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauhan). They
have a rich tradition and not to mention larger than life Chauhan king,
the [Prithviraj
Chauhan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prithvi_Raj_Chauhan) who is fondly
remember for his valour among the old and for his love affair with
princess [Sanyogitika](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanyogita) among the
teens. My forefathers belonged to this clan. They have been known for a
fierce individualism which is the hallmark of them and the reason of
their downfall. Grouping always have benefits over individual but anyway
they dies with pride, that is enough for me. Chauhans are generally
considered soft in nature, quite a painful insinuation in the land which
is surrounded by more feudal clans of*Jats, Vishnoi, Thakurs, Chaudhary*
etc. Perhaps this is because due to the fact that domestic violence is
the lowest among them. So the childhood is passed without witnessing
much violence and that mellowed them down.They also have a long
tradition of treating women with utmost pride and dignity. I am so proud
to share that heritage.The relative sanity of my village is due to the
lack of interest in alcohol and other manly stuff. One of my teachers in
High School who was a Jat used to lash out on his fellow Jats, "These
Chauhans, they have learned to learn. And you....!" \
\
So I stand here in front of you. My first name is like Muslim as to
prove my Iranian links. There is symbol of 'OM' permanently tattooed on
my right hand as to symbolize my 'Vedic roots'. My clan shares their
genes with Greeks who are quite famous for their Mathematics and
Philosophy. And of course not to mention the educational exposure which
I have been through which is by large is Western. I inhibit in myself a
long and rich history. This makes me warm again and again.\
