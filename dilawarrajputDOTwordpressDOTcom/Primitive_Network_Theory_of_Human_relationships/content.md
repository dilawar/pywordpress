We intend to differentiate males and females. In fact, we are going to
make them complementary to each other. Surely, this is an
oversimplification for both of them exhibit certain behaviors common to
each other. This is more or less an Utopian view of human race. This is
not to say that 'if men are from planet X then women are from planet Y.'
We only say that both are from the same planet but given an option would
chose different directions.\
\
Humans are not complete without emotions. In fact, these emotions make
them impossible to define in plain and simple terms. Here, we categorize
emotions into two sets. When an action of a single human effects an
individual emotional state and creates an emotion, we say it is an
'individual induced emotion' (**IIE**) e.g. jealousy or envy after
seeing someone's car, hate and love for an individual, anger towards an
individual because he/she has done or said something etc. When an
emotion is a byproduct of an action of a large group, we call it 'group
induced emotion' (**GIE)**e.g. Hate for Muslims after 9/11, caste based
discrimination in India, hate for alien cultures, envy for some nation's
wealth, respect for a brave race etc.\
\
Similarly, we also classify actions. Any individual action which causes
IIE (or a GIE is a very small group) is classified as 'individual
oriented actions' (**IOA)**e.g. showing off wealth in neighborhood,
shopping useless but fancy products, public display of affection
etc.** **If an action by an individual is done to influence or create
**GIE**is called 'group oriented actions' e.g. actions of politicians,
saints, intellectuals, scientists etc.\
\
We are confused where to put humor. We consider it as 'zero' element of
our emotions. It is present in both GIE and IIE. The purpose of 'humor'
is also not well defined. We can not say why individual uses humor while
making an argument and why people who are humorous can say many things
which they would not dare say in plain terms.\
\
Lemma 1 :**A human male is like a capacitor. **\
\
Capacitors are usually not coupled. Charging and discharging of one
capacitor does not affect the charge on other capacitor (unless they are
coupled). This is to say that a male in a group is not at
all interested in others IIE. He is mostly interested in GIE for his or
his group benefits. A group of men can live together without causing
IIE. This is an oversimplification.\
\
Lemma 2 : **A female is like a inductor.**\
\
****Inductors have this property of 'mutual and self inductance'. They
are mostly coupled to each other. Any instant of charging or discharging
of an inductor changes the state of other inductors. This is to say, in
a group of females, any action of one female emotionally influences
females in group. They causes IIE. This is to say, they mostly talk
about personal stuff in for the sole purpose of enhancing or reducing
IIE's of the member of groups. This is also an simplification.\
\
NOTE:  Group induced emotions such as motivation, inspiration,
patriotism (love for fellow citizens), nationalism (hate for
foreigners), enlightenment, humor are caused by GOA. GOA changes
'intellectual emotions' (if I can say it that way) while IOA targets IIE
('personal emotions'). We are not saying that female only communicate in
a way which only causes individual effects. We meant to emphasis on the
fact that one can clearly see the females have inclination for this kind
of behavior.\
 \
Lemma 3 : **A relationship is 'oscillation' in a circuit formed by L and
C (we are not considering R right now). Strength of a relationship is
the frequency of oscillation. **\
**\
**\
Theorem 1 :** A capacitor (inductor) can be converted into a inductor
(capacitor) by using a gyrator.**\
\
Proof can be located on internet easily. This is to say, with some
extra circuitry called gyrator we can make a capacitor behave like an
inductor and vice versa. Equivalently, a male can behave like an female
and vice versa, with the help of some 'means' (gyrator). To keep this
blog short, we leave this undefined.\
\
Definition : **A lasting 'relationship b/w male and female' is like
sustainable oscillation in a capacitor-inductor circuit without
consuming any power.**\
**\
**\
Well, to  understand this one has to take basic course in 'Network
theory'. We assume that you have taken it. Now, we restate the common
wisdom in our language.\
\

> For every capacitor (male) , there exists a inductor (female), and

\
Its almost impossible to define a matching pair. Once defined, finding
is not a tough task. Existence of such pair is
mathematically guaranteed in our theory.  According to this blogger, if
one chooses to form a relationship, one can look out whether they have a
common and mutual understanding. If yes, then the oscillation can be
sustained with little or no effort (with a weaker power source).\
\
We still have not touched the 'resistor' (externalities or friction in a
relationship). We now stop building this theory. We may come back to it
some other day. May be someone else might like to build it up. I am
convinced that one can not go very far with it. It is doomed to fail
because '**no human behave like a circuit element'.** Anyway, you get
the ideas.\
\
PS : My friend pointed out that nothing changes if I consider males as L
and females as C. I was thinking of considering children as small coils.
Since mothers have much more influence on their children, this is only
possible if 'females' are inductors else coupling is not possible
between them. On this, she called me crazy :-p :-(\
