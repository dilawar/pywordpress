WEEK 3 :
========

Meeting time : Saturday, Feb 09, 2013 It was canceled because Prof. HN
was not available.

WEEK 2 :
========

Meeting time : Saturday, Feb 02, 2013, 2.00pm onwards This week only
15-20 students turned up compared to 44 last week. It was announced that
[Prof. Sanjoy K. Mittar](http://www.mit.edu/~mitter/) who is visiting
the department would be interacting with students. It seems that
presence of an eminent scholar did not increase their enthusiasm. Prof
Mittar is in his seventies and he talked slowly. He drew a sharp line
between scholarship and original research. He pointed out that one can
keep learning his whole life and build a scholarship but it does not
necessarily lead to original research. I am not sure if he put a larger
value on original research. Prof Narayanan quoted a line from a poem
which he read in his school. This line is 'to see the world in grain of
sand' which he interpreted, 'do a small problem and do it thoroughly and
one would learn a great deal about other things'. Prof. Mittar also
suggested that one should prefer to pursue one's Ph. D. in a field which
is less crowded. Perhaps, so that there is more scope for creativity. He
also made a distinction between science and engineering. While the
former is about discovering the fundamental limits, the later is
concerned about maximum limits. Prof. Mittar has a line of research. He
emphasized that IITs must engage themselves on the national problem as
MIT has been doing. I asked him whether he sees a difference between
intellectual cultures of India and US or IIT Bombay and MIT. He made a
point that IIT Bombay surely can not hope to replicate the resources MIT
has but there are certain areas where IIT Bombay can work effectively.
He was not sure whether it answered my question and I replied in
negative. Of course, I had to explain my point of view and sociologists
are notorious for not able to make their point in nutshell. I mentioned
that my point of view is usually the point of view of sociology (HN
chuckled) which studies how the cultures (or the habit of hearts) define
the way an individual acts. We compare and contrast. Therefore I was
curious if he noted something in our culture compared to US culture
which can act against doing research. This discussion lead into another
direction which I terminated. He asked whether I want to be a
sociologist. I did not rule out the possibility. He mentioned light
heartedly if I knew that sociology is in crisis. 'Well, they say there
is a crisis everywhere these days', was my answer to it. He smiled and
suggested as one can also define crisis. I found him to be a very
generous, kind-hearted and down-to-earth man. It was nice to have him in
our meet. The reason behind reduction of number of students joining the
meeting is not very clear to me this time. Whatever is the reason behind
it, it has to be conceded that we do not put very high value on such
meetings. Of course, they can be inspired and encouraged to join but it
does not contradict the hypothesis that their natural inclination (or
habit of hearts as I'd like to phrase such things) is not for such
discussion. This is not to say that this can be changed. Such
discussion, where students exchange ideas with each others and suggest
some probable solutions to one's problem, are great facilitator of
research in any academic institute. And we have a poor record in such
discussion in our department. We have enthusiasm for starting magazines
and start-up. These magazines and start-up do not survive for long but
they are a great thing to be put on one's resume. I have heard one
undergraduate complaining that the reason behind such startup is to get
admission to London School of Economics. I can't vouch how much truth is
there in this assertion but it is not entirely false. Magazines or
newsletters can be a by-product of discussions, it can not replace
discussions altogether. Most of the great research institutes are there
where they are these days because they had this tradition of building
groups where people put great values on such a culture. Students can not
be faulted for this. This is prevalent among faculty in our universities
(our department has good record when it comes to the tradition 'talking
with each other'). They divide themselves into factions, euphemistically
called 'like minded intellectuals'.  Now we have more number of students
on the department but on feels that Prof. Betteille is right when he
observed that while our universities 'proliferated and grew in size',
but could no longer 'conform to the original concept of a self-governing
community of scholars — they are neither self-governing nor do they have
a sense of community or scholarship.' What I wish to look forward to
study in following meetings is that whether they are showing a growing
sense of community of scholarship (or original research as its
byproduct).

WEEK 1 :
========

Prof. Harihar Narayanan (HN) retired last month from Electrical
Engineering Department. He has been be at the center of student
mentor-ship program for undergraduates at institute level. I believe
that he had some success with academically poor undergraduates. And
since department has tried hard to retain him for few more years as
adjunct-professor, he plans to devote one day each week to mentor
department’s research scholars. Each Saturday we will meet to discuss
this-and-that. This is a great opportunity for me as a sociologist to do
some field work as participant-observer. And to get some taste of social
life also. In the last meeting, there were around 44 PhD students,
mainly from EE and some from CSE department. Few of them were new
students but mainly they were senior Ph. D. students. He likes to talk
and feels rejuvenated after giving a good lecture. It was not easy for
him but he tried hard not to make this discussion monologue. He
encouraged students to point out problems and to offer suggestions and
comments for the department. Many of them are listed below. Not in the
same form they were uttered by the students, he generalized many of
them. It was a moderated session and a senior faculty was present.
Therefore many of these comments and complains are very mild compared to
what they usually complain to their peers. The Indian habit of
‘comparing everything with the worst’ is not visible. There is a good
chance that something useful will come out of this. **Complaints**

-   Research (in India?) driven by publication rather than originality.
-   Not always \`relevant’.
-   PhD students dont work hard. (No one complained about it, this one
    he put on board by himself).
-   Little or no office space.
-   TA duties not always spelled out clearly and workload is not shared
    properly.
-   How to make learning/exploration enjoyable.
-   Sometimes a student is interested in a topic other than the allotted
    one. (On this he talks for a while. He suggested to steer the
    problem according to your interest)

**Suggestions**

-   Should be a balance between theoretical and practical work.
-   Originality should be encouraged.
-   Maths dept should be bigger!
-   There should be more intra/inter department interaction.
-   Social interaction with faculty/guide.
-   Crash courses by PhD students within and outside dept.
-   More interaction with external world (It was suggested that they
    should also teach in engineering colleges. It will help them to
    learn and also to earn some money.).
-   How to make all students flourish simultaneously? (He generalized
    some other suggestion)

**Comments**

-   Mentoring should be its own reward (He strongly emphasized on it).

It was surprising no-one complain about the amount of money they are
getting during their Ph.D.. This is a major concerns shown by students
who leave India for higher studies (I myself has heard students saying
it many times). I am not sure money is the only thing they will miss if
they remain they India. But they like to point it out forcefully. At the
end, he asked student to write small autobiography to be submitted in
the next meeting. This autobiography will be confidential. He stressed
that autobiography should contain likes and dislikes and strengths and
weaknesses as perceived by students. He also asked students to come
prepared with their topics (where applicable) and present to smaller
groups first (5- 10 minute presentations) say 10 in each group (60-70
mins). They must cut out jargon so that talk should be understandable to
an educated layman.
