Those who know [how cricket
grew](http://www.flipkart.com/corner-foreign-field-0330491172/p/itmczz2b9qhmhjhz)
in India will agree that community pride was the major force behind the
promotion of this game. Cricket had a very large following in India,
even [before independence. It had influenced Indian
politics](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/651075) to a much larger
extent than Indian historian have written about it. Cricket came to
India with British who played it to amuse themselves in an alien land.
An acute observer of British ways, Nirad Chaudhary, once remarked that
to Englishman abroad, literature was his wife and sport his mistress.
Books and games provided twin consolations by which he came to terms
with an alien - and potentially hostile - culture and environment. 'Two
monsoons', it was said, was all that colonial would expect to live
through. The first mention of cricket in India dates to 1721, when
British sailor played a match among themselves in the [port of
Cambay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khambhat). Slowly and steadily,
this game of cricket, like the British flags, established itself at the
coast of India before penetrating the untamed hinterland. Wherever
British soldier went, they formed clubs and played cricket. Game was
followed by dinner and dances where the cricketer 'might try their
abilities in another way'. It appears that British had no intention of
teaching the natives to play cricket. They only played this game as a
welcome retreat from a utter strangeness of life abroad. Their social
clubs were the inventions by which they recreated the social life of
their motherland. These clubs generally 'boasted of a few books', but
provided space in which to play and drink afterward. Some Anglo-Indian
were so devoted to their club that they refused to go back to England
after retirement. They built home near their club, spent the days in its
library and the evening in the bar, and instructed their heirs to be
buried somewhere within striking distance of the eighteenth green. At
these clubs, food served and entertainment were English, the wine may
have been French. But the only concession to India was the commonly use
suffix, gymkhana, which derived from gend-khana, or ball house. The
British would play and Indian serve. These roles were neatly delineated
in a description of Calcutta Cricket Club, circa 1840 :

> On the cricket arena stand two spacious tents, not, however, like the
> paltry affairs bearing the name in England, but lined with fancy
> chintz, furnished with looking glasses, sofas and chairs, and each
> player's wants, wheather it be a light for this cigar, iced
> soda-water, or champagne, supplied by his turbaned attendant.... The
> natives do not enter at all into the spirit of the game.

Some British have left behind  their memories  of  these matches. The
matches were exciting, often won or lost in the last over. After play
ended billiards was played and whiskey drunk. A donkey was placed in the
camp-bed of a colleague who was the last to leave the bar. These English
games, however, almost fell victim to an unknown Indian. For 'on that
tour', remembered
[Bagot](http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/a-g-bagot/sport-and-travel-in-india-and-central-america-oga/page-6-sport-and-travel-in-india-and-central-america-oga.shtml),

From [Bagot
accounts](http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/a-g-bagot/sport-and-travel-in-india-and-central-america-oga.shtml),
it seems that in both city and village the Indian had no feel for the
cricket at all. The 'native mind has not grasped the delicacies and
intricacies of "yorker", "longhopes", and "half-volleys", but rather apt
to look on the cricket match as proof of the lunatic propensities of
their masters the sahibs, and to wonder what possible enjoyment they
could find in running about in the sun all day after a leather ball'. In
the great city of Calcutta, where Bagot was once stationed, the only
Indian with a connection to cricket was the club's official,

> "Fecknee waller," or thrower, who was by no means bad practice; very
> straight and very fast, of course with no break and little variations

These are the  narratives of mutual distaste. The sahib thought the
natives unfit to bat or field, although they might bowl - after a
fashion - for a wage and tip alongside. He also thought that Indian
believed him to be a fool or lunatic to play cricket. In another
recollection by another British underlines how Indian had, strictly
speaking, not part of cricket itself. 'I was at Ballygunje', remembered
A. A. Leslie,

> when George Craik hit a ball out of cricket ground on the Old
> Ballygunje Road side. A tikka gharry was passing with the coachman
> fast asleep. The ball dropped in the gharry but it did not wake the
> coachman and the horse went on quite unconcerned. The gharry was
> chased by chokras and the ball retrieved by one who demanded a rupee
> for its return.

What should interest us is not how the native is represented but where
he is placed. It thus appears that Indian might roll the pitch or serve
the whiskey. He might even watch the game (out of curiosity) and, at a
price, retrieve the ball or throw it for the sahibs to bat back. He was
not expected to play the game. But he would. \*\*\*\* Among natives, the
first one to pick up this game were Parsis, a 'comprador' class which
allied themselves with the British with great mutual benefits. The
community of fire-worshipers had fled their native Parsia after the
coming of Islam and, and settled along the cost of western India. They
preferred commerce and trade, professions viewed with disdain with
high-born Hindus. When Bombay emerged as a center of power they
gravitated towards it and in time graduated to the law and colonial
civil services. 'After the advent of British in India', remarked[one
chronicler](http://www.dli.ernet.in/cgi-bin/metainfo.cgi?&title1=Parsi%20Lustre%20On%20Indian%20Soil%20Vol-I&author1=Darukhanawala%20H.D.&subject1=GEOGRAPHY%20BIOGRAPHY%20HISTORY&year=1939%20&language1=english&pages=806&barcode=99999990134431&author2=&identifier1=&publisher1=Caxton%20Printing%20Works,%20Frere%20Road,%20Bombay&contributor1=&vendor1=NONE&scanningcentre1=cdac,noida&scannerno1=0&digitalrepublisher1=Digital%20Library%20of%20India&digitalpublicationdate1=2006-02-28&numberedpages1=&unnumberedpages1=&rights1=OUT_OF_COPYRIGHT&copyrightowner1=&copyrightexpirydate1=&format1=%20&url=/rawdataupload1/upload/0133/093)
about Parsis, 'the dormant qualities that lay concealed in the Parsi
bosom ... obtained free scope.' While Paris elders were making a kill
[doing business and
commerce](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/4360398) with British  --
especially in opium trade with China -- Parsis boys were watching
British playing cricket. With their 'elastic and fascinating characters,
half oriental, half occidental',  they took readily to a Western sports
too. In time, they improved their skills to a considerable level but the
journey towards making a respectful team was not easy. Anyway, in time
they began playing against Europeans and started defeated visiting
English county teams. The match between Parsi cricketers and the touring
Englishman was the greatest sporting contest in the history Bombay. A
decade later, the home captain, J. M. Framiji Patel, recalled how 'the
city went mad on the game'. Business came to a halt for two days, as a
crowd in excess of 12,000 streamed to the Bombay Gymkhana. This ground,

When the match ended and Parsi has won, an Englishman wrote a less
appreciative account of Indian crowd. 'The crowd that demonstrated at
the close of the match', wrote Captain Philip Trevor,

This is not an over-reaction. British knew that the negative result in
cricket match played against the native is a blow to the prestige of the
empire. These two accounts are only a glimpse into the making of
social-history of Indian cricket, a much neglected subject. Natives
derived an immense pride in defeating their colonial masters. If Parsis
could defeat British, why would Hindu and Muslims not follow the lead?
They also formed their teams and started playing against, and sometimes
with, Parsis and Europeans. Paris, Hindu, Muslim and European were not
the only community in India playing for pride. Later another team 'The
Rest' was included, thus a pentangular was formed. You may call it the
IPL of those days. Natives and British may have played with same passion
but they loved cricket for different reasons. British loved it, as one
of them suggested, because it '*is a standing panegyric on the English
character*'. The player '*must be sober and temperate*' and '*patience,
fortitude, and self-denial, the various bumps of order, obedience, and
good humour, with an unruffled temper, are indispensable.*' He added
that '*poor, rickety and stunted wits will never serve: the widest
shoulders are of little use without a head upon them : the cricketer
wants wits down to his fingers' end.*'. Thus the rule of cricket, and
still more its ethos, most fully embodied the self-image of the
Victorian elite, its aspiration to set the standard for rest of the
humanity. Why natives loved cricket? Why not hockey? Dhyanchand and his
men was doing which no country in hockey has managed do; defeating the
world in Olympics without conceding a single goal. Why cricket was so
popular in India while it was entirely unknown in freedom-loving
America, socialist Russia, the whole of Europe, Japan, China, and most
of Africa. One essayist wrote in Illustrated Weekly of India
high-lightening this craze about cricket that while 'Every nation has  a
preoccupation. In China, it is Mao; in Latin America, it is Revolution;
in India, it is cricket.' One reason was of-course the joy of witnessing
British loose. For an Indian, native defeating British mattered much
more than Indian hockey team defeating 'Monsters of Mars'. But others
and equally important reasons were also there too. Bombay pentangular
tournament was of communal nature. Teams were formed on the lines of
religion and passions flared up during these matches, especially when
played between Hindu and Muslims. Players on the ground were cordial as
gentlemen but fans were not behaving well. Outside the cricket field,
politics and religion were married. While factions in Congress was
fighting within itself on community and ideological lines, Jinnah had
convinced his followers that Congress party was anti-Muslim. The
provocation for Hindi as national language and insulting remarks towards
Urdu played their parts too. Those who were not aware of all this, found
this Indian love of cricket puzzling. Janaki Das, the secretary of
Indian Cycling Federation, attended World Championship in Zurich, where
cyclists of other nations to him of their abhorrence of cricket. These
conversations were summarised in an article published in the *Bombay
Chronicle* on his return. The delegates at Zurich, reported Das, were
amazed by the keen interest which his nation of 'starving millions'
showed in expensive and time consuming sport. French added that the game
of cricket '*implies the particular characteristic of the British,
namely hero-worship which leads to slave-mentality - the greatest boon
of the British to its so-called Empire*'. The delegates were unanimous
.... that only aristocrats who do not know value of time and money can
indulge in this game.' Americans, too busy with his pursuit of
happiness, would stop a while and have a look at this game but would not
sit for five days for it. Not a single game American play cost that much
time. But time did not matter to Indians. It is a species which usually
thinks in thousands, sometimes even in millions, years and talks in
eons. Five days are just a blink of eye. Food was abundant and money
mattered little to majority. Situated in temperate zone, India could
easily produce three crops a year. So when stomach is full, time
abundant and little care for money, what is stopping them from playing
and watching cricket, a game infamous for its elite nature. Since then
Indian cricket has changed a lot. With the growing Industrialization,
time became a luxury which not many can afford to waste, especially
those who can pay to watch it. A businessman, a office-worker can not
afford loosing five-days for a single game, no matter how much he
desires. Thus there was a growing appetite for shorter version. Radio
might have helped in the past in following the game while at work.
Television took away that luxury too. Unlike radio, one has to sit
in-front of it to enjoy anything on it. A shorter game was a need of
time which can be seen in one sitting to its conclusion. I have little
doubts a hue and cry must have been raised by puritans when One Day
Internationals were first played. Twenty-20 format invites similar
criticism. Is it cricket? Surely, it is not the same game which a
British described as a game where '**poor, rickety and stunted wits will
never serve**' and  where '**the widest shoulders are of little use
without a head upon them**'. And the cricketer must have '**wits down to
his fingers**'. Twenty-20 gives more opportunity to a mediocre player.
Wide shoulder, even without a head on them can outperform one who has a
calm head and artistic wrist. A Brian Lara, a V. V. S. Laxman, a Rahul
Dravid and a Sachin Tendulkar worth little in this format. Those who
enjoy 'the subtlety of the longer form', how a player builds an innings,
and how a bowler bowls a probing spell must find it disappointing.
People in villages  can not like it much. Poor people tends to be more
patriotic and connect with national team more passionately than with a
team owned a Malya or an Ambani. A win matters to them much more than
how elegantly a shot is played. IPL has also been criticized for
depriving a vast humanity of India of a team which they can claim their
own. With what pride a Jharkhandi can say 'hamara Dhoni' whenever he
hits a winning six for CSK? Or what goes on in the head of a rural
Bengali who find a Ganguly playing against Kolkata? It matters to a vast
Indian population, no matter how ridiculous it seems for Homo
Economicus. IPL finds its cheerleader exactly in those places where it
wants them to be. They are in metros, hotel-pubs and IT industries. This
class is always short of time and prefers a short frenzy of stimulating
activity. They would not mind supporting T20 even if it means [decadence
of the
game](http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-05-12/edit-page/31670147_1_ipl-indian-premier-league-franchise-owners). 
They are not only comfortable but also supportive of the idea that their
national icons can be turned into personal properties of some rich
people. And they may not like to take any criticism of it lightly. For
criticizing IPL means criticizing spirit of entrepreneurship and is akin
to racism. Being young has its own benefits. I have grown up watching
ODI's and preferring it over Test Cricket. I am not troubled with purity
of the game as our older generation seems to be. Indian team success or
failure does not invoke much passion now as it used to do in school
days. Perhaps the knowledge of how economy effects people has also took
a toll on me. For my generation, revenues generated by IPL matters more
than national pride. How much money a player is sold for attracts more
eyeballs, if not the gray cells connected to them, than a debate on
intricacies of the game. I enjoy this format. I watch IPL and will
continue to watch it as long as my team (CSK) is winning. But is it
cricket? It is as much cricket as a pornographic movie is a work of art.
And perhaps that is what troubling its supporters and critics alike.
Those who supports it vehemently can not deny the havoc it has wrecked
on the 'artistic side' of cricket and also to the performance of
national team in longer format. Those who condemn it in public, like
pornography, can not deny its charm in private. End Notes : [1] For a
